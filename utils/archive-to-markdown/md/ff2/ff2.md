Summarization of Final Frontier 2 Episode 1
The crew of six (Emmett, Matthias, Seth, Laav, Serpile, and Jacob) end up docking at a space station orbiting Earth. The group is poor with only 1000 D and little to no fuel. After bickering occurs between Laav and Seth, the majority of the crew explores the space station. Emmett ends up taking a small mission on his own to get quick cash, however said quest wasn't as it seemed. He took a bleeding obese man from the mission board to a hospital far away on foot, exhausting him and matting his fur with blood. Meanwhile, Laav, Matthias, and Seth take a mission from the president of the space station. Tasked with protecting his daughter, the three were on the verge of getting 15000 D! However, after Seth fucked her, she died. Seth and Matthias used her body as a puppet, using Jacob's voice for her speech. The mission failed. The three take 14000 D worth of stuff from the area and leave. After a shower, Emmett finds out Jacob has a dolphin in his ass. The goat then took it out and left to go to a pub. He meets a minotaur woman, who at first thinks he's weak and immature. After a crude drinking competition, the minotaur is impressed and Emmett continues to drink. He ends up drinking gasoline. Seth prevents him from dying and the goat is taken by the woman for some fun in the ship. However, after a while, the minotaur takes off her mask to reveal her true self: a goblin! Seth and Emmett airlock her out together. Emmett then drives the crew to the planet below, leading us to now.
Space Rule of the Episode:
Space Rule 50 - No Goblins.

Summarization of Final Frontier
As the crew lands upon Earth, they end up meeting a strange man made out of shadow. Claiming to be patrolling the area for space invaders, newcomer Asier is greeted by Serpile and Emmett. Seth, on the other hand, leaves the greetings and goes on a quest for sex and medicine for Emmett. The goat, still sick out of his mind from his drinking of gasoline, ends up puking in front of both Asier and Serpile as they went to get fuel. He proceeded to go back to the ship, while the others continued forward. Serpile was able to get Asier to join the already compact ship of bounty hunters, while Seth found the temple with the accursed "artifact" he was looking for. Meanwhile, Asier and Serpile found themselves a general store. After being confused from the labyrinth of aisles that greeted them, they found out that there was in fact no fuel on the shelves. Rather, many of the fat men on motor-scooters were prepared to steal the fuel in their asses. After having found out their fuel was gone, the fat men were outraged, willing to kill both Asier and Serpile and even having the guts to put Serpile in one's ass. Emmett. after having cooked himself a home remedy of fried grass, went out to find Seth. At the temple, the two of them were obstructed by a pit. Emmett passed it with ease, and Seth fell immediately. After struggling to get out of said pit, Seth found a tunnel that lead to sexy holographic ladies. Emmett, on the other hand, was met with heads on pikes. A feisty masturbation and a stabbing of a hoof later, Asier, Emmett, and Seth find the artifact: a moldy hotdog with rotting mayonnaise. Seth eats it and a whole bunch of stone women start following the trio. They then found themselves back in the ship, crowded by stone women.

@Final Frontier
We last seen our crew members in a slumber from the mysterious stone women. Asier is first to wake up and wakes up the others. With the restroom being out of order, Emmett pisses in a jar of the urinated hotdog artifact. This ended up making him feel better from the gasoline he drank two episodes ago. Being a jerk, Seth then throws the jar of piss at Matthias, causing Serpile to lick the urine off of him. Serpile then dies. The rest of the group then travels for a minute distance before Emmett gets mad at Seth. The goat man pulls Asier away for a walk and tells him a story of his childhood. As it turns out, Seth had nurtured Emmett since he was a teenager due to the death of his family in a peasant revolt. Asier and Emmett then come upon a Novakid, who is seen to be patrolling the area for suspicious men. Emmett, with his charisma, gets Bail to then be against the cops and join the crew. This turns to chaos quickly. Asier plans to loot the police station, whereas literally everyone else, excepting Emmett, wants to murder the police. Even some random ghost dude, named Garrick, joins in on the fun. Immediately, Bail and Seth both murder five cops. One of the surviving cops, named Jim, proceeds to try and protect his station, but misses and shots another cop. Emmett, pissed off from the crude intentions of his crew members, proceeds to leave to the ship. The members in the station eventually handcuff Jim, which causes the last remaining cop to become enraged. She started to twerk, causing an AK-47 implant in her ass to activate, shooting at everyone. Bail was the closest to being shot, but a conveniently placed revolver took his place. Everyone goes back to the ship, including the three newcomers. Emmett, realizing he has company, gives some strawberry pastries to his new crew, mildly irritated at how much their raid failed.

> "Ah, an adventure to be had--Oh! You're awake!"
Squemfet's father made sure his towel was tightened and picked up his son. It was easy to do so--their height difference was about one to two feet.
"Why were you soaking so early? The shower woke me up!" The boy wasn't upset, rather, his curiosity overtook him.
"Why, we're going off-planet!"
Off-planet? How exciting! Aside from the regulations that prohibited anyone under fourteen to leave Vortox-56, anything could happen.
"I have your temporary permit and everything all set up. We just need to be home by nine in the afternoon."
"Let me get ready then!" He was excited. Squemfet never knew of any way to bypass the law of the church, even it was only temporary. The man put his son down and smiled vividly.
"Praise Squoat!"
Praise Squoat indeed.
(edited)
> "Are you ready, Squon?"
His father was clad in some hunting attire, holding a high caliber laser pistol in his hand in a submissive manner. He handed it to his son without hesitation.
"In case things get hairy, I need you to carry this. Depending on the weather, the place we're going may not be safe." Squemfet nodded at his father's warning. He was a little anxious for his journey now, but he knew his squather would keep him safe.
"Let's get going before the traffic kicks in."
> "You see squon, the reason why I brought you here was to show you my inspiration. My oyster. My demi-Squoat." The kid's father was ecstatic about being here, but Squemfet was not as pleased.
"It's kind-of empty, isn't it," he inquired.
"Past that cloud barrier is our destination." The parent meant the wall of smog that protected them from the suspense abd possible horror contained within. Squemfet swallowed hard. He did not feel right being here.
> "Is this how you start your astounding books?" His dad was a highly acclaimed author in the Squoatling community.
"Indeed. Sometimes I have to tone it down out of fear of the Squingling though. He's a pain in the ass sometimes." The Squingling was the head priest of the Squoatox religion. He had full control over everything that went on in Vortox-56, along with his band of parliament.
"Hey squather, I think I found a Squoatling burial grounds." The kid shuffled his feet a bit in the dirt before walking up to a gravestone.
"Squemling Tarfoot. Didn't you know that guy?" His father fretted a bit, thinking for a moment.
"Why, he was a civil rights rebel. He was shot down for defying our Squoat." This gave an uneasy feeling in Squemfet's stomach. After looking through more graves until he found one with a small purple tulip in front of it.
"...Squemfet Tawfeek? Squather, look! It says my name!" The kid backed up as his father checked on the stone. Suddenly, the ground started to shake unnaturally.
> Squemfet, out of a sudden state of adrenaline, uppercutted the zombie off his ear and headbutted it, nearly knocking its head off. He was panting. His fur was darkening, and he was bleeding badly from his ear. But before Squemfet endured any further Crave-induced changes, his father stuck a syringe in his neck, rendering him unconscious. The father took his son out of the field and more importantly, out of the misty barrier.
> All Squemfet remembered for the rest of his day was when he woke up in bed at night. He had tubes hooked up to his neck, along with a heavily bandaged left ear. The kid didn't know what he got into on that planet. But he promised himself not to be so horrible of a shot in the future. He promised himself that he would ask for target practice. He also promised that he would never leave his father again in his own time of need.

**Zander** *(05-Sep-18 04:33 PM)*
> So here's my answers to Mica's list, in case any of you need an example.
> Full Name: Squemfet Tawfeek
- Name Meaning: Mountain of Squoat
- Like Their Name: Could care less. It's very similar to his nickname.
- Nickname: Emmett
Age: 21 GUYs
- Age Appearance: To a human, probably like 13 years old.
Eyes: Yellow with goat pupils.
- Eyewear: He occasionally wears a set of goggles with red lenses. They help him identify substances and highlight possible targets.
Weight: 97 lbs.
Height: 5'
Appearance:
- Skin, Fur, Type Etc.: Fluffy fur that seems to have a naturally taken care of quality to it.
- Hair Color: Pale Brown
- Apparel: Emmett normally wears a long sleeved tight red shirt with orange streaks lining his shoulders to his wrists. He also wears a set of gray dress pants that aren't too special. No shoes due to his hooves.
Health: Probably below average due to him being life's scapesquoat.
Favorite Music: Tends to listen to the Earth 80's based soundtrack that plays on the GU Radio.
Favorite Food: Grass
Personality: A generally helpful character with bouts of laziness. He tries to be semi-flirty with the ladies, for which his attempts are hit or miss. He is mostly nonviolent and tries for diplomacy or avoidance in most situations.
> - Daredevil/Curious: Curious. Definitely not willing to take risks.
- Educated/Uneducated: He was given an aristocrat's education on Vortox-56 for 10 GUYs. As for space, he is experienced from 6 GUYs worth of learning and first-hand experiences from Seth.
Habits:
- Good: Tends to worry for his friends' conditions, Ponders about solutions for the episode's problems, Carefully thinks out his consequences, Openly looks for a lifelong companion.
- Bad: Can usually only focus on one person at a time, Is lazy after doing what he needs to (unless it interferes with a friend's well-being), Tends to inherit life's troubles (Scapesquoat), Openly looks for a lifelong companion.
Hobbies: Documenting his findings of planets and their qualities (off-episode), Drinking, Tinkering.
Family: Is dead. His father was a well-reknowned author, well known for fantasy stories that were against the church's jurisdiction. His mother worked as a part-time baker.
Friends: The ship crew. That's it.
Fears: Seth will eventually bite off more than he could chew, the Floran's strange obsession with an emotion, life would deal him the worst of hands.
- Deepest Fear: The eradication of the Squoatling species.
Worst Thing That Could Happen to Them: Probably him being forever alone romantically/death.
Favorite Thing: Flying, honestly.
Favorite Person/Role Model: Probably Seth. They butt heads a lot, but Emmett admires his confidence and fatherly figure.
Breaking Point: The Crave, Seth going too far in his selfish desires.
Events:
- Best In Their Life: Finding Kambras, Seth's Heist of the Fornicating Sceptre.
- Worst In Their Life: The destruction of his home life, family, and planet.
> Secrets: He has an attraction to Sanya, but not exactly sexual; likely due to her plant prowess and freedom. He cries at least twice a week in bed due to his planet and family's condition. He finds Llamanians attractive romantically. He has his own dating profile on some obscure dating site in Hyperspace, which is probably how he finds certain women. (I.e, Kambras, the Minotaur, etc.) He plays it off as if he's meeting them for the first time in front of his friends.
Special Relationships:
Seth: Like a father.
Sanya: Mostly as a coping mechanism.
Maia: Possible romantic interest.
Hector: Probably good friend considering he saved his life.
- Sex Opinion: "Sex is a beautiful thing. Two companions get together and have some of the wildest and most intimate times in bed."
- Sex Drive (if any): Quite average, unless drunk. He's mostly a sub. ¯\
(ツ)
/¯
- Cute/Sexy (or neither): Cute +6
Flaws: Lazy, Scapesquoat, Possibly a Hopeless Romantic, Alcoholic (trying to get off of it).
Self-Esteem: Emmett appreciates himself for who he is. He does beat himself up for not saving his family, and for not getting a good girlfriend.
Selfish/Selfless: Selfless. Not sacrifically in terms of fate though.
Self-Differentiation: He tries to make himself look cool, similarly to Seth. It's easy to see through his guise though and find his "nerdiness".

> "Oh, fucking hell."
> "Seth! Get out here right this instant!"
There was no response, even after multiple requests.
"This has gotten out of hand."
Emmett had to push the door open due to the pile of clothing in front of it. Clothing was strewn all throughout the floor, increasing in concentration as the eye continued to Seth's bed. He was asleep with two holographic girls, each with an obvious fluid projected in its midsection. The Kid was getting impatient.
"Wake up, dipshit!"
This got the attention of the unconscious Seth, causing him to open up his eyes and unnaturally bolt straight upwards.
"Emmett, is that you?"
> "Why did you leave all of your fucking sex toys all in the navigation system? This is the third ship you've ruined this GUY!"
Seth, having been rudely awakened from his slumber, was grouchy.
"Leave me alone, furfag. I need somewhere to keep my stuff."
"Dirty condoms and wet tissues? Are you serious right now? That's trash!"
Seth got out of his bed and stretched, towering above the little Squoatling.
"This is my ship. I choose where things go. Fuck off."
Emmett put his hands on his hips, unaffected by the height difference between them.
"I can't fly correctly with your shitty sex supplies always in the way. Get them out and move them in here man."
Seth furrowed his brow, pausing in what little rational thought he had. This pause further upset Emmett, seeing as how his friend was acting like an imbecile.
"So? Going to get rid of your crap for me?"
> "What'ss going on?" Sanya witnessed a drunkenly mad Seth storming towards The Kid with hostility. She jumped in between them without thought, hoping to protect the weakling out of maternal instinct.
"You're not hurting him!" Hector ran back into his room to grab his syringe gun, hoping to subdue the raging elf. Meanwhile, Seth reached the floran and stopped.
"Get out of the way Sanya. I need to teach this kid a lesson."
"What the hell iss wrong with you?" Seth suddenly shoved the plant, causing her to fall upon her back.
"Someone needs to learn their fucking boundaries."
With the help of Sanya's distraction, Emmett fled into his room.
> "Oh no you don't!"
What wizardry was this? Seth, having came into the room, dragged Emmett from one of his hooves out of the underside of the bed. The canister was left underneath, but Emmett was able to latch onto his satchel.
"Fuck off, lead-head."
"I've had to take care of you for nine GUYs and this is how you repay me? By disgracing me and my practices?" Emmett tried to spit at his capturer out of disgust, but due to his upside-down position, he missed and hit his own snout.
"You need to learn how it's like to live on your own, twat."
> "I was starting to like you too Emmett. What a shame."
"The fuck do you mean?" Emmett concealed his terror. He was about to be airlocked out of his own ship. A mutiny in the making--aside from the fact that he was merely the co-captain. He was dropped in the airlock chamber, and before he could get up, the doorway sealed itself. Rock bottom.
"Any last words, furfag?"
Emmett looked in his satchel for answers. He had nothing left. He was about to be pummelled into the infinite abyss. Emmett prayed for the first time in ages. Prayed to Squoatanity. Praised his Squoat.
"Get a life."
Seth was just about to press the airlock when a well-shot, high-concentration tranquilizer dart stabbed into his neck. His fall was unpredictable, however. Seth's hand pressed the button right as he was knocked unconscious.

**Zander** *(14-Sep-18 08:20 PM)*
> Nothingness. Void. Vacuum. These were all that Emmett could see as he helplessly floated away from his ship. He was lucky to even be alive. Before Seth pushed the button, Emmett found something in one of his late father's books. Titled, "The Fiends Without Squoat", there was a small present embedded in a rectangular hole in the first few pages. Labeled "Do Not Use Unless Necessary", the dead grub in the pages was meant to be crushed in one's hands, as described later in the story. Emmett crushed it right before he was discharged. His body was encompassed by an insect-like exo-skeleton. (Emmett practically looked like he was in a TRON™ suit, but with more organic and insectoid armor.) This exo-skeleton insulated him from the perilous depths of space, and in addition, respirated him with the help of an oxygen generator. The suit was old and discharged however; the power that kept him alive was leeched from his communications system.
> That was, until he saw a ship in the distance. It was not his own, but rather, a small cruiser. The vehicle was dashing towards him, to the point that he felt as if they were bound to save him. Alas, this was not the case. The small passenger ship sped past him within feet of his face, causing him to yaw clockwise. Now he was spinning on two separate planes. Delightful. It wasn't much longer until a fleet sprouted from behind the ship, obviously in pursuit. His hopes came up again. Of all the ships chasing the getaway, one of them slowed down to accommodate to Emmett's position. He was rescued. With the use of a tractor beam, the Squoatling was dragged to safety.
> "Must've been a hell of a reason why you'd be deserted from your own ship, huh?" Emmett tried to take off his helmet before realizing the anonymity it granted him.
"I was kicked out of my own ship."
"You're lucky to be alive then."
"Yeah." Emmett pushed himself up and slowly propped himself on the stranger's passenger seat.
"Are you guys chasing the speeder down?" The man patted his passenger seat and began to accelerate; the entrance from whence Emmett entered sealed itself tightly.
"This guy stole our most prized possession after gaining our trust. We're a troupe, you see." Ah, the infamous space troupes. So delicate in performance but just as dangerous and unpredictable, if not more than, a bounty hunting clan. Emmett liked how this actor was not inquisitive about his being, but rather focused on his goal. He took his place in the passenger's seat and watched as they zoomed towards their target.
"Need me to man the turrets? I've had experience."
"Look, I trust you just as much as any other stranger I pick up in the middle of space. I can't afford that artifact being blown to pieces though. Just sit tight." Emmett uncomfortably shifted in his seat, feeling unsatisfied in the moment. He decided to recollect his thoughts on his situation. Was he really in the wrong? Did he infringe on Seth's boundaries? The more he thought about it, the more guilt he felt. Maybe he shouldn't have been so upset. Maybe he should've just picked up his guardian's trash. Maybe he--

> "What's going on?!" The Kid looked up and gasped. The blue insignia on each ship told it all. It was the Llamanians. The ones who ruined his childhood. The ones who killed his parents. The ones who erradicated his home planet. After being shipped out of his vessel, Emmett knew what he must do. He couldn't hide anymore.
"Sir, do you have any firepower?" The man was in the process of requesting backup from other space troupes.
"Are you insane? That would be suicide! We need to get out of here!" At that point, The Kid took off his helmet, revealing to the ringmaster his Squoatling qualities. Emmett took a white ribbon bow and tied it around his forehead.
"This is my calling." The ringmaster nodded without further argumentation. He was knowledged in Llama-Squoat warfare, considering that it was broadcast throughout the galaxy nonstop for a week. The leader tossed Emmett a Ryno-45, a plasma-based shotgun with a higher-than-average range, along with some spare ammo.
"Anywhere you want me to launch you?" The ringmaster had a newfound confidence to him. The Squoatling put on his helmet and pointed towards the largest vessel, the mothership.
"May Squoat have mercy on us all."
> "TAKE YOUR LITTER BACK OUT OR BE SUBJECT TO EXECUTION BY THE LLAMA EMPIRE." The troupe leader then was acquainted with hundreds of other mismatched ships, overmatching the number of ships in the armada by half. Suddenly, the ships, rather than surrendering, started to fire upon the Llamas. A warzone began to form, along with casualties, powerful ship weaponry, and stray ammunition. Although Emmett's trash pile was mostly unaffected, a few beams were close to hitting him. As he reached the mothership, he latched onto it and strafed his way along a convienient ledge to a hangar bay. (Unfortunately, a banana peel did not make the journey.)
> "Hey! Don't move!" The Llamanians on his left were well armed, whereas the one on his right was trying to apprehend him. Emmett flipped off the safety of his gun and held the trigger out of view for a moment.
"I said 'Don't move'! We will shoot!" As the Llama finished speaking, Emmett aimed at two of the men on his left and released. The two of them fell, considering they were close enough to receive a concentrated blast of ultra-heated matter. The third fired at the trespasser, but the blast was absorbed by Emmett's shell. He took out the remaining two Llamas and noticed that the crevices of his apparel were now glowing green. As it turns out, the concentrated energy of the laser his opponent shot charged his armor to a functional state. Emmett took out his satchel then and quickly skimmed his father's book; he learned the suit's few enhancements through the book.
> "Hah! Imbeciles like you make me want to weep for their moronic deaths." The figure, clad in a power suit with a Llamanian insignia upon it, drew a phaseblade. The figure quickly, before Emmett could react, swiped at Emmett's side. The blade had no effect.
"Typical." The figure's blade then switched to a sharp, metallic one. She tossed him a similar weapon, insisting that he put away his gun.
"Let us dance." Emmett looked at his Ryno, and promptly aimed at her. She swiped the gun out of his hands with her sword.
"Pitiful, uncultured beast." His opponent immediately attacked, swiping at his right arm. Emmett then evaded, ducking down to grab his sword.
> "What isn't fair is your lack of civility." It slashed again, for which attack Emmett accidentally parried; he did not counter her attack. Emmett lacked any experience with a sword, however, he played along, constantly backing up to reach for his gun.
"Don't think you can get away so easily!" The being forcefully slashed into his shoulder, breaking into the shell. The kid groaned in pain, fleeing by sliding away. He grabbed his gun and hastily aimed, hitting only her non-dominant arm. The being hissed in agony.
"Oh, you want to play dirty? I can play dirty." The armored figure imitated Emmett's clumsiness, walking towards him. He backed up, having coincidentally ran out of shots in his current battery pack. As Tawfeek reached the wall, he fumbled with reloading, having dropped his sword when grabbing his gun. The being reached within a foot of him, and pressed a button on the side of her helmet before mockingly falling forward and headbutting him. The impact felt like an anvil. Emmett was certainly out for the count.
"Loser can't even defend himself."
> "Finally awake? I want to see the fear in your eyes as I behead you." This was it. He had no way to get out of this one. Emmett was too weak to break out of the bonds and he had no way to defend himself, if that mattered. He felt that paranoia from earlier. He thought of how this could've been avoided if he only took out Seth's trash. Now, his life's goal was doomed. He was doomed. The whole Squoatling race was doomed.
"Any last words?"
"I would spit on you if I could." The being laughed a little from his comment and afterwards attempted to take off his helmet. It didn't realise how tight it was on his head. Eventually, the helmet was off, and the bruised face of a defeated Squoatling with a silly white band revealed itself. The being hesitated. This hesitation was so strong, it made it drop its executioner's tool. Emmett looked to the being in its face, raising his brow a little. His executioner took off her helmet as well, showing to Emmett a white and grey collage of fur. She was another Squoatling.

> "Look...Remember when a group of scholars were sent off to Yamax before the war?" Emmett, still bound, nodded.
"Yeah. They were foreign exchange students with the Llamanians."
"Precisely. I was one of those scholars. When the war started, they immediately locked us up, with little rations for the ten of us. We still studied with the other Llamanians, but we were tested much more cruelly." Emmett was getting uncomfortable due to his wrists being tied. As she spoke, he began to try and slip out of the rope.
"Low grades meant torture. We were whipped, branded, and starved for low grades. It was terrible. People started dropping like flies. In three weeks, we fell from ten to eight. Eight to five; five to three. In the end, only I prevailed. Instead of refusing to answer loyalty questions on tests like the others, I got them correct. I was shunned. Exiled from our little group from Vortox." Emmett finally had his wrists undone, but out of sincerity, he still listened on.
"From then on, I was put into less academic education over time. For a three GUY period, I was put through rigorous combat training by the Llamanians, to the point of life or death. They tried to kill me at almost every moment they could get. Only at night could I had a resting phase. As time progressed however, my perseverance began to show. Their tactics were less and less creative, and I always expected the worst. I came to be respected. Feared for my survivability. 'Above the lowlife qualities the others protrayed', as the Captain stated."
"I see. You were practically forced into servitude."
"Or I would have perished, yes." Emmett frowned at her last comment.
> "I'm unsure. We need to get you out of here though. I'm not seeing one of my kin die on my watch. Wait a moment." Josephine looked up him.
"You could have escaped that whole time, couldn't you?" Emmett swallowed a little.
"Yeah, I could."
"Why didn't you? If you weren't a Squoatling I totally would have ended you." Emmett paused for a long moment, looking for the words to say.
"It's okay if you don't want to answer. We just must like an hour ago--"
"I felt hopeless then. That was, until I met you." The woman furrowed her brow in confusion.
"Wait, huh?"
"Squoat amour, Fina. Furgaz squaleiz." (In this context, this pretty much meant, "Squoat gives his kindness to you, Josephine. I love you for who you are." He didn't mean love in the romantic sense, obviously.) Emmett stood up and smiled coyly; he stretched casually. On the other hand, Josephine covered her face. She was blushing from his statement. It felt like a millennia ago that she would have heard such heartfelt and cherishing words.
"Are you okay?"
"I don't know how to feel."
"What do you mean?"
"Just, everything."
> "What's taking her so long? She's just changing clothes," Emmett mumbled to himself. He went up next to the door and knocked on it.
"Just a second!" She sounded like she was stressed from her speech. Rather than to provoke anything, The Kid backtracked and whistled a soft turn to himself. Soon, the female Squoatling was out.
"Here. Sorry I took so long."
"You're fine." Josephine was in a skin-tight Llamanian suit fitted for a Squoatling. It was general wear for those aboard the ship. She was visibly frowning, pulling at her collar.
"What's wrong? Need to talk?" Emmett was more concerned about her state over the suggestive qualities of her suit. Still, his eyes wandered here and there.
"Just...Nothing. The sooner we get you out, the sooner I'll feel better." She tossed him her suit, which was surprisingly lighter than what he thought. The Kid took off his shell with little ease in front of her.
"Need any help?"
"I got it." He then slipped right into her armor and fitted the helmet on.
"Sheesh, this stinks," Emmett grumbled.
"Yeah, I know. The Llamas stink too...I mean by odor, that is." Tawfeek tilted his head at this comment.
"Just get on out of here. I'll meet you at the end."
> "Oh, Seth." It must have been a day since he was launched from the ship. A day since he was a pilot. A day since he even ate. Although he wished to be back at home, Seth's temper tantrum did bring him to the girl of his dreams. (That wasn't saying much though. He just wanted any female Squoatling.) Emmett stopped for a moment and leaned on a wall.
"Y'know, this place isn't so bad."
"I'd hope you would think so." A tall Llamanian with shades and battle armor appeared in front of him.
"Hey babe. I've been looking for you everywhere." It seemed that her helmet had a voice modulator in it! Or at least Josephine planned ahead and snuck it on there while in the restroom.
"Oh. Hey."
"I was just going to chill at the Brozone for a bit. Want to swing by at around five for some..." The Llamanian started to air thrust his pelvis. Emmett wanted to puke. He just showed him a thumbs up and stood away from the wall.
"Grreat. See you then, Tiger." Emmett then learned that he really needed to get going.
> "He's a cute guy, but I'm unsure of his deal." Squosafina spoke this aloud unintentionally as she passed by an open-door cafe. She was looked at as if she were crazy. This further proved her Squoatanity. She wasn't even allowed to speak to herself without getting weird looks from the Llamas.
"Hey, Josephine!" Her drill sergeant bumped into her from behind.
"Oh, hey--"
"Where's your armor? You know it's mandatory to wear it around the ship!"
"I, um--"
"You're going to be late for a meeting at this rate! Get the fuck ready or I'm reporting your tardiness to General Guak." Shit! She knew she had forgotten something. Josephine really needed to get to the escape pods now. She could not face another strike on her record!
> "I'm so glad you made it here safely." She hugged him tightly. Emmett did not think she would react like this, feeling a little awkward. Before he could hug back, Josephine realized what she was doing and tried to rid of the tenderness of the moment.
"I'm holding you like this to pull off my armor, by the way." Emmett sighed of relief, taking off the helmet and slipping out of her breastplate, gloves, and greaves.
"It was really hot in there. How do you do it?"
"There's an air conditioner in here, you know." She pressed a little button causing a soft fan to spin. Emmett now felt stupid.
"That's unimportant though, we need to see if the coast is clear." Josephine put on her helmet and peered around the corner.
"Shit."
"What?"
"I forgot there's a security card reader in place."
"What would happen if we ran through it?"
"The alarms would go off." She was not wrong either. The Llamanians were very strict with access procedures on the mothership.
"What would happen if you got caught?" Josephine lowered her head, signifying guilt.
"I think this is my second to last strike. They would probably take away my grass privileges for a week, too." Emmett mentally gasped in horror.
"That's terrible!"
"Well, how are we going to get you out of here?" Emmett looked over to his partner with sincerity.
"Jump the alarm with me."
"What?" She was surprised.
"Come and escape with me. You'll be free. And safe..."
"I can't, I don't think--"
"And not alone."
(edited)
> "Do you want me to come?"
"It would make me the happiest Squoatling in existence, Squosafina." She took off her helmet and looked him directly in his yellow, horizontal eyes.
"Furgaz squaleiz, Fet." Emmett finally hugged back, resting his ear on her shoulder. She acknowledged the tender feeling and replicated it, tearing up a little in the process.
"Intruder!" Emmett looked over Josephine's shoulder, seeing three armed guards. Suddenly, Josephine stood up.
"Sorry for this, Squemfet." She suddenly picked Emmett up and charged through the card reader, starting the alarm through the mothership.
"INTRUDER ALERT IN THE ESCAPE REGION! ALL SECURITY PERSONAL REPORT TO THE ESCAPE REGION!" The three charged their arms up, with the leader hesitant to shoot. He saw her grow into who he believed she was: a bloodthirsty and cold-hearted killer.
"Don't do this, Josie, you know I don't want to hurt you." Right as Emmett heard this voice, his face was knocked straight into the glass of a pod. He was out due to Josephine. Again.
"I'm sorry, Regimald. I'm not a Llama. I never was! And I never will be!" Right as she pressed the "OPEN" button on the pod, Regimald shot his dart, in her arm. He was giving his only semblance of a daughter a chance to leave with the intruder.
(edited)
> "What the fuck, private!" Josephine was downed, her groans negated by the severity of the alarm. She then was put to sleep from the concentration of the dart.
"Rules are rules, Regimald." Right as the escape pod left, a gun fight brewed on the Llamanian mothership.
> @Final Frontier
Here. It's a bit longer than the others, I believe. It doesn't even finish the sorry yet. Fourth part will be a short resolution back to the ship.

> "Ah, shit." Emmett woke up with his mouth foaming with blood. Apparently the impact with the glass was too much for his fragile stature to handle. The Kid spit up a tooth, with appeared to be the cause of his bleeding.
"At least it was only a tooth." He put his hands up to his lower jaw and checked for any damage, adjusting it as he needed. Luckily, Squoatling teeth were regenerative. He picked his dislodged tooth and inspected it out of curiosity.
"I guess no meat for me for a while." It was one of his few canines.
> "Ugh." He pulled himself up and noticed a hole in his partner's armor.
"Josephine...?" The Kid gently shook her before realizing she was out cold. Awkwardly, he pulled off the legs of her armor. In her right thigh was a wound half a centimeter in diameter; a huge bullet was in her leg.
"Damn, what happened here?" He looked around for any cutting tools, aside from her sword. (Emmett did not want to hurt her any further.) He stuck his ear to her chest to ensure she was still breathing well. As he did this, the Squoatling took our his satchel, hoping to find something. Unfortunately, the satchel was not the cure-all as he previously had thought; the only helpful thing he found was his Squoat doll.
"I think I might need to get my hooves dirty..."
> "Oh man, that's in deep." Emmett put his head up to the hole to see it better. The bullet must have been embedded at least a centimeter in her thigh. He inhaled before trying to take out the ammunition. Emmett was disgusted. He did not like this one bit. Inside, he was hurting; he felt the pain he could have been causing. After a few minutes of digging within her, he jumped.
"What the fuck, Squemfet!" Josephine bolted up, causing Emmett to fall back.
"Don't- Don't touch that... Shit." She stared at her thigh, panting.
"I was just trying to help!" Emmett was ignorant, blind to the fact that he could have potentially killed her through blood loss.
"Squemfet, don't take out bullets unless you're a doctor." She bit her lip out of agony.
"Oh..."
"Just get me something to cover it up with, will you?" He was shaking, feeling guilty from his actions.
"I'm sorry. I didn't think--" Josephine furrowed her brow.
"I know, I know! Just get me something. Please!" The Kid quickly tossed her his Squoat doll without second thought.
"Is this your Worship Do--"
"Yeah, it is. It's a little embarrassing, I know."
"I think it's cute...!" The end of her comment was met with the stinging pressure of his plush doll. Emmett kept his hands to himself, figuring that he had done enough already.
"Your doll is very personalized, you know that? Makes me a little upset to bleed on it." Josephine chuckled softly to herself.
"I was born into a rich family on Vortox," Emmett responded.
"Aristocracy? Oooh. Very nice. Always thought I would make it with a rich man." Josephine was clearly joking to lighten up the mood. She smiled over to her partner to show him that it was going to be alright.
"Always thought I would find myself a strong woman," Emmett played along.
> "I'm so glad I met you." Josephine had Emmett's Squoat doll tied to her thigh with a cloth from his shirt.
"And I you, Squosa."
"Did you just give me a nickname?"
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"Squem, you don't have or be sorry about everything, you dork." She coyly smirked at him. Emmett folded his hands together and put them in his lap.
"Sorry for being so uptight. I'm just...nervous." It was hard for her to keep in her laughs.
"What? Want to be more than friends or something?" She said this in a jokingly manner, but Josephine was solemn with her question.
"Exactly." Josephine softly sighed and stared up at the blankness of the roof. She had just met him possibly less than a day ago; it was impossible to accurately tell the time after they were knocked out.
"We're the only two left, huh?" She tilted her head towards him, resting her cheek on one of his floppy ears. Emmett slowly nodded.
"Squem." She rolled towards him and grinned. "I don't think I have much of a choice then, do I? Not that I mind the thought." Emmett sunk into his collar, smiling softly to her gorgeous blue eyes.
"Don't push it, cutie. I still need to get to know you."
> Emmett woke up from his computer desk. He had accidentally fallen asleep while searching for jobs on the Hypernet. He looked around his apartment environment, finding a rather lived-in bed, a mass of paper balls surrounding his trashcan, and two dressers. Emmett scratched his beard, having not shaved recently. Outside their room was a small hallway which led to their bathroom and general room. The Kid strode out of his seat into said room, pulled away some curtains and looked out of the tinted window. For miles, all he could see was buildings and roads, each filled to the brim with traffic. He felt exhausted. The neverending rain tended to cause that on a man who had just lost his occupation. The two Squoatlings resided in one of the tallest complexes on the planet, on the floor second to the penthouse. This was one of the benefits of Josephine's work reputation.
"Oh, how would she react?" Emmett muttered this to himself as he took out a mug and poured some of his Squodka in it; he was stressed. Soon after this, he laundered back to his room, searching endlessly for a suitable replacement.
> "Why, you're home early."
"Yeah..."
"Why's that?" The purple Squoatling took a seat in the kitchen, laying her stuff down and positioning her legs around opposing side of the chair.
"I got laid off from Vegetation Co. Apparently economy's dwindling and they can't afford me to continue working."
"What? But that's where we get our grass supply."
"I know." Thinking about the topic of grass, he took out a bundle of the green stuff and split it for the two of them to share.
"You need to get your butt up there and demand your job back."
"It's not that easy, Squosa--"
"Squem, we need the stuff. Remember the last time we ran out?" Emmett shivered. Although he had no collection of his own strength, he believed she was more monstrous than him on The Crave. A severe kick to the groin taught him to keep her filled on the plant.
"I'll go tomorrow, love."
"Furgaz gall."
"Furgaz galle." (Roughly translates to "I love you too.) Josephine rose up from her seat and licked her partner on the cheek.
"I don't know what I'd do if I lost you again."
"I promise that won't happen again. I'll find a way. Even if the veggie factory fails." The Kid reassuringly put an arm around her, sighing softly.
> "You've talked a lot in the last week," Josephine mused.
"Hey!"
"But yeah. That Seth dude?"
"My old caretaker from a GUY ago. He's finally contacted me." Emmett cut a hole in the pack and poured its contents into the skillet.
"That's nice. What did he say?"
"Well, he typed in Elfish, somehow. I translated that and it was a long message about how he wants me back." She raised an eyebrow.
"What does that mean?"
"He wants us on his ship."
"You mean you, right?"
"No, I talked to him about you and I. Apparently they brought in another Squoatling while I was gone."
"Really?"
"Yeah. All Seth told me of him was his romantic affliction with plants."
"Strange." Josephine got up and walked over to him.
"Squem, I don't think we should leave. I mean, we have a great living quarters here on Daerthlorn. I have a great job in the battle dome."
"Surprised you weren't covered in blood when you came home." She tilted her head a little.
"But look, Squosa. On this ship, we're above the law. We're able to legally hunt people down and plunder for treasure." Emmett took the skillet off of the burner and started putting some veggies on Josephine's plate.
"Isn't that dangerous? I mean, if we were to, say, be killed, our actions could cause our culture to vanish."
"We're safer in space than here. Remember, I'm always looking out for us." She rolled her eyes and jabbed a fork into a potato-like veggie.
"I hope you know what you're doing then, 'man of the house'." After she said this, Emmett took his fork, having impaled a ketchup-covered, carrot-like veggie, and smeared it on her arm playfully.
"Squem!"
> "You ready, squaby?" Josephine poked her head into the now-empty apartment cell.
"Damn, you cleaned up quickly."
"Yeah, I'm ready. Did you talk to the manager?"
"He's already selling our room as we speak!" Wow. What a time for the economy to boom. Emmett held out his free hoof for her.
"Well?" She grabbed his hand and held it tightly. Josephine was anxious. She couldn't wait to see what was out there waiting for them.
"Let's go." The two Squoatlings left the apartment in lieu towards the elevator. The outside represented hope for them. A new beginning. An escape from the sickening lifestyle of corporation and into the free and fertile regions of space.

> 500 years in the future, the world has reset itself back to caveman days, while rummaging through the ruins of a building, the cavemen find a hard copy of final frontier. as time goes by it's passed down generation to generation until someone finally finds a way to read it, the cavemen are amazed by the accomplishments of the people of their past and all the planet's they traveled to, all the strange creatures they meet. the cavemen from that day forward work on returning humans to their former glory, it becomes a driving force that unifies all of humanity, they work hard for many generations, progressing at a rate much faster than humans ever had before. after 200 years they have achieved space travel. A select crew is sent to go find everything mentioned in the book. Only when they get out there they learn everything humanity had worked for for the past generations was a lie. the crews moral crashes with the weight of their discovery.
> the crew decides to spare the rest of humanity from this discovery and never return. after earth learns the ship has gone missing they assume it has been destroyed, they get a stronger, battle ready ship and prepare to launch, when political turmoil over where to go and should we go starts up delaying the launch for generations. eventually the ship launches after repairs and upgrades to it are made. The ship only finds one sign of intelligent life, the first ship humans sent out. they find the crew dead and take their logs home with them. when they return to earth and announce their findings and read the logs of the previous ship humanity is sent into global dispare. Factions start forming around what they think humanity should do next. The factions start warring with each other and eventually destroy civilization over their war. the surviving faction leaves earth and takes to space, traveling to a different planet. but not everyone was on that ship, primitive humans started emerging from the rubble several years later

“Danny! Danny, wake up!”
I slowly opened my eyes to see bright ocean-blue eyes looking down on me from a perpendicular view.
“Adea, before I open my eyes, how much time is it before sunrise?”, I groan.
“Umm, three hours before sunrise,” Adea mumbles.
“Wake me back one hour before please,” I request.

> Well I guess if you could say all the fucked up stuff started when my parents died. I was sent into the foster system and probably should’ve stayed there because no one would want me because of what I am. I’m a half-breed technically speaking my existence shouldn’t happen
because of the conflicting natures and races of the Snow Elves and the Dark Elves. You see the Dark Elves are believed to be born from fire while the Snow Elves… well that’s self explanatory and because of this one race is always trying to destroy the other and so on. When I met my foster family they seemed so nice, I mean they took in a half-breed like me. But the moment I got home Jacob.. No not Jacob, Him. Monsters like that don’t deserve a name pinned me against the wall and said “Here’s what gonna happen you little Knife-Ear (A insult to the Dark Elves because they’re considered not Elves.) your gonna do what I when I say or else you get a lashing you hear. “Y...yes” I said,
LASH
I did nothing but tremble in pain and scream. “When I address you, you answer with a Sir do you fucking understand.” “Yyy..yes S..sir.” I say between whimpers of fear. “Now get to work” he said before he threw me to the ground and gave me a rag and some water. That’s how my life was for the next 3 years until I found something wonderful. I had been walking home in my long sleeve shirt, in case you’re wondering I wear it to hide the cuts from… nevermind. But I was walking home from school thinking about the project where we have to build a pseudo-weapon when I ran into this girl that looked familiar and we tumbled down the hill into the forest.
> She had white hair, freckles, icy blue eyes, and was about my age the weird part was she was dressed in some of the finest silk I’ve ever seen yet she’s walking down a commoner’s pathway? “Sorry!” she said. I try to quickly say “I..it’s fine, it was my fault.”. “So what’s with the fancy gowns?” I try to say to be casual. That when she says “Oh my mother makes me wear them but my name is Theyla! What’s yours?” she’s says with here hand outstretched and a smile on her face in return. I say “Mine’s Deyner” I then shake her hand but she’s just gazing into my eyes and looking as if she’s getting up the nerve to say something and then finally says “What’s with your eyes they look like a…” She never finishes as I complete her sentence and say “a Dark Elf’s… They look like that because I’m half dark elf, I wait for her to freak out and run away but she justs grins and says “That’s so cool!”. I’m startled that she thinks that being half Dark-Elf is cool most people call me a freak or a mistake, I look around for my stuff having forgotten it that it fell when I realized that we’re in the forest. “We should probably get out of here.” I say in which she nods in return. When I stretch my foot I notice I hit something metallic and hard on the floor. “What was that?” I say. Before I could investigate any more I was interrupted by a some yelling “Theyla! Theyla! Where are you!?” That’s when the girl named Theyla said “Sorry I must leave, See you soon?” I stuttered and said “S..Sure.” and then I realize something and say “Wait! Your the princess aren’t you!?” And she just winks at me and says “maybe, See ya soon Deyner!”

There's a time skip of two weeks between today's episode and next weekend's.
Our food supply is dangerously low, with members being reduced to two meals a day by the second week.
We have been lost in deep space yet again. The beginning of the episode marks the end of this strandedness.
We are entirely broke in terms of Ducketts.
Sanya is fully recovered from her last battle. No signs of Dread have occurred. She quickly becomes a good-hearted friend for both Iris and Emmett. In addition, she learns of Emmett's "squom" ordeal.
Seth has been irritable due to being without sex for two weeks. Plan accordingly.
Garrick and Chomsky have been plotting something, sticking to Chomsky's room for isolation. Despite this secrecy, Chomsky has asked Emmett for more books to read.
Despite being undernourished than usual, Jim looks more buff than before. He's been using asteroids as target practice at the pool area.
Iris has been getting emotionally better from her encounter with her father, but she still is unsure of the coordinates she was given. She and Emmett have been spending more time together, learning of each other's backstories and whatnot.
Everyone is more tired and exhausted than usual. There may be a health debuff to the crew due to them not taking care of their necessities like good bounty hunters should.

Danny, on the other hand, isn't starving. Due to his garbage gut, he is able to gain nutrients from everything and convert it to what he needs. In addition, he has been practicing his malletwork, nearly making a hole in his wall due to his strength.

Emmett's been just hanging in there. He's been feeling gloomy due to his food shortage and the reoccurring thought of his lack of romantic companion. During this period, he's been drinking more heavily, even getting drunk a few times, surprisingly.

Short Quotes with Emmett During this Two Week Period:
Chomsky
E: "Hey Chomsky. Could I have one of my squather's books back?"
C: "No."
E: "Why not?"
C: "Your culture is really interesting to me."
E: "Really?"
C: "No."
Chomsky goes back into his room.
Danny
E: "How's it going Danny?"
Da: "Pretty good. Been eating some iron to bump these up.
Danny flexes, which really just looks like a blob.
E: "You've had food this whole time? We've been starving out here!"
Da: "My bad. Here."
Danny tosses him a bar from the ship.
E: "Oh."
Deyner
De: "Emmett, could you toss me that tool out there? My machine launched it out of my room."
E: "Okay then."
Emmett slides it under the door.
De: "Thanks."
Deyner continues working on his contraption.
Garrick
G: "Emmett, I need that box right now."
Garrick steals it from his grasp.
E: "What the hell Garrick?! I'm using that!"
G: "Rest in peace, E-met."
Garrick phases through a wall to Chomsky's room, leaving only a hammer from the box.
E: "Damnit."
Hector
E: "Morning, Hector."
H: "Morning, Squoatling. You look malnourished."
E: "Well, we're sort of out of food."
H: "...I just got out of hibernation."
E: "Martians hibernate?"
H: "I might have hoarded a load of food in my hibernation... And I might have eaten it all."
(edited)
> Iris
I:
Slips into the bathroom while Emmett is showering.
E: "Iris? Is that you?"
I: "Maybe."
E: "Why do you always come in here when I'm showering?"
I: "I dunno'. I'm comfortable talking to you in here."
E: "Interested in seeing my hot bod?"
I: "No, no."
E: "Are you sure you're not?"
I:
Iris blushes.
"...No."
Jim
J: "Emmett, you really don't look too well."
E: "It's a seasonal thing."
J: "No, I mean, you look frail and sick."
E: "Eh."
J: "You should give working out a chance. Really gets your blood pumping."
E: "I'll pass, but thanks."
Matieu
M:
Matieu sneaks up on Emmett and cuts some of his fur off.
"A fine specimen. Hector will be pleased."
E: "Hey! Why did you do that?"
Emmett feels the spot he cut.
M:
Matieu scurries away to Hector's room.
"Haha! The genetic specimen is mine! Mine!"
Sanya
Sa: "Oh hey Emmett."
E: "Hey
hic

> “Danny! Danny, wake up!”
I slowly opened my eyes to see bright ocean-blue eyes looking down on me from a perpendicular view.
“Adea, before I open my eyes, how much time is it before sunrise?”, I groan.
“Umm, three hours before sunrise,” Adea mumbles.
“Wake me again, one hour before please,” I request.
“But Danny it’s the big day! Come on, come on!”
“What do you even plan to do while we wait for it to start?”
“I don’t know but I’m just so ready to join!”
“I know you are, but the academy isn’t going anywhere.”
“Then can you wait awake with me. Pleeeease Danny!” Adea pleaded with her large ovular eyes.
> “Fine, fine,” I comply. Even though I am a morning person, my blue sister always has too much energy for her own good. I had to learn to control my energy and convert it into useful ways, but it took GUYS with no one to help. The academy eventually helped me to use this to my advantage. Hopefully it will have the same effect on her. After all who else was going to help us. Now the time of GUY has come again when the 8 GUY olds are allowed to take the academy’s entrance exam with a chance to become some of the finest warriors on Planet Popstar. This GUY that list includes Adea, I’ve helped her train and study to ace this test after she claimed she wanted to reach the heights of a Star Warrior just like my own goal.
> Following the blue outline of Adea we walk into the expansive living room which covers about fifty square feet complete with a hundred inch TV with surround sound. The living room opened up into a clean kitchen filled with utensils and a fridge holding foods from fresh eggs from Earth and sweets found here on our home planet. The government cares for all of our expenses including the rather luxurious house my sister and I live in as well as any activities outside of the house such as sporting events and movie screenings.
“Will Hesper be coming today as well?” Adea asks out of nowhere.
“I’m not sure if she can make it today, it was hard enough for me to get a few hours off to see your ceremony. I’ll call her on the way to see, is that ok?
> Hesper, to put it bluntly, is my only friend; she is also one of the few people that have treated Adea and I nicely. Adea treats her as if she were her older sister and the two get along very well.I've known Hesper for about seven GUYS, since our entrance into the academy at eight GUYS.
Adea and I are… different from the rest of the population. While the poyo race is known mostly for its tan and pink skin tones, the small human population ranges from pale to dark brown. The poyos rarely get above four feet and ten inches and the humans are usually towering over at a minimum of five feet and 6 inches. I am expected to be done growing now that I am fifteen GUYS, but I've still grown another inch in the last 2 months, now I reach five feet and Adea is currently at 3 feet and 6 inches. The both of us, oddly enough have blue skin tones, and we don't know why, we don't even know where are parents are to ask.
> “If we're up this early, we might as well do something for the next few hours. How does training sound Adea?”
“Ugh, but I don't like training in the morning, can we do something else?”
“Nope! To the basement we go!” I yell while grabbing Adea and throwing her over my shoulder like a pack of sand.
“Sheesh, what have you been eating, boulders?” I joke.
“Hey! That's mean!” Adea yells as she pounds my back.
“Should I roll you down these stair?”
Adea froze in what one can only assume to be absolute terror. “You wouldn't.”
“Do you really want to know what I would and would not do?”
“Fine… Can we at least start with shooting?” she asked after I set her down to descend the stairs.
“Sure, should I assume you want the bow.”
“You know me so well dear brother of mine.”
“Then take this,” I say as I toss her a six inch pole with a grip in the middle.
“I asked for a bow, not a pole,”
> “Before you look so dejected, wrap your fingers around the grip and thrust your arm forward” I explain.
Doing as I said the end of the poles popped out and up in the form of a compound bow.
“So? What do you think?” I ask.

> "Squem, how much longer are they going to take? I feel like I'm melting."
"They just left a few minutes ago," responded Emmett. Emmett had a paper fan out and was fanning off his partner's face for her.
"Damn... Do we have any drinks?"
"I don't know. *Someone* stole our supply like an hour ago." He was referring to Sanya in this situation--she was drinking can after can of soda to maintain her stature as a plant. "I don't know what to tell you, Squosa."
"Is it cooler outside yet?" She had asked this question at least once already; Squosafina wanted to get out of the ship and do something. Emmett raised his eyebrow.
"You know we would burn out there," Emmett consoled. He then took off his shirt, throwing it on her face. "It's too hot for shirts right now anyways." Josephine smirked, putting the shirt down on the bed.
> "Not right now, Squosa. Maybe later."
"But it's your Squoat-given day!" The female Squoatling was right. It was his birthday, and they were spending it on the ship with nothing to do.
"Nothing sexy, if you want to please me so much." Emmett scooted over to her, licking her cheek. "Let's just keep today light-hearted, okay?" Josephine sighed from his response.
"Then what do we do?"
"Let's just chill." Squosafina, rather than to chill, hopped out of bed and started looking through her chest, located next to her dresser. "What are you doing?" She started to throw items behind her out of the chest.
"Just cleaning," Josephine replied as she tossed her sword onto the bed. Emmett immediately grabbed it and started to mess with the weapon.
"You should really teach me how to wield one of these things." Emmett slashed back and forth, causing him to press the button on the handle. Similarly to everyone else's weapons on the ship, her blade switched out for a dildo. How convenient.
"What, my sword?" She looked back and giggled at him. "I mean, I could teach you how to wield *that* instead." Emmett pressed the button again, switching the weapon to its normal state.
"I think I know how to use one of those, thank you. I meant your sword." A set of handcuffs whizzed by his face onto his lap. "Handcuffs?"
> "Help me, Squosa! They latched onto me!" Emmett exclaimed.
"You're such a dork. Meanwhile, I don't actually have the key for those." Emmett shuddered.
"Shit."
"Now you're actually helpless." Squosafina took the last item, rope, out of the chest and jumped onto the bed.
"Well, I still have my hooves to use." Planning on pranking him, Squosafina sat on his legs and took off her jacket.
"Now I can do as I please," Josephine said as seductively as she could. She took the rope and put it aside, unzipping his pants for him.
"Squosa, I said no! Get off of me!" Emmett was not amused. She pulled his pants off and threw them to the door.
"Take a load off."
"I don't want to do this." Squosafina couldn't contain her laughter; she wasn't that good of a prankster.
"You should see your face right now." Emmett groaned, now annoyed.
"You suck, you know that?"
"And you swallow, you big wuss. That's what you get for keeping me caged in here."
"I can't help that," Emmett complained.
"Your underpants are cute, you know that?" The black garment had little hopping goats throughout its perimeter.
"Get off of me please."
> "Your butt is too heavy!" Squosa stuck her tongue out at him.
"Looks like you're going to have to wait then." She then took the key to the handcuffs out of her pocket.
"You lied to me!" Emmett squirmed to get from beneath her. Purposely, she shifted more weight on his legs.
"Furgaz gall, Squem."
"Furgaz galle," Emmett muttered, laying his head back in frustration. Then and there, the door to their room opened.
"Happy birthday, Emmett!" Seth, Sanya, Hector, Iris, and Chomsky flushed into the room, surrounding him.
"Oh, fuck me," Emmett whined softly. Josephine winked as the vignette closed in on her, ending the episode.

"Oh! I'm terribly sorry," Hector noted.
"We'll be on our way then," Sanya continued. Iris was blushing hard; this moment brought her memories of her past relationship with Emmett: awkward, yet lovingly maintained. Seth raised an eyebrow.
"You guys seriously think they're about to fuck? She's on his feet."
"Thank you! Sheesh!" Emmett furrowed his brow at his partner. He knew she was trying to embarrass him today. It was a game between them after all: embarrass one another until one gets fed up and asserts their dominance over the other. Josephine was definitely winning at the moment. "But thanks for coming in here."
"Seth, he's nearly naked. What do you mean, they're not going to... do that?" Sanya looked away from her figurative son and looked away. "Sex is disgusting anyways." Right then and there did Squosa position herself right atop of Emmett's crotch, just to get the others' reactions.
(edited)
> "Make me, you chair." Seth could not resist a good laugh. His experience in the bone zone allowed him to know what she was doing.
"Emmett, you're getting beaten by a girl? Weak." Squosafina looked back at the elf and winked, casually shifting her weight periodically. Emmett, however, felt really flustered.
"Squosa, in front of everyone else?!" Iris could not handle this; the girl left the room without anyone noticing. While she knew she could never be with him again, Iris was envious of Josephine. She wanted to be with him, cuddling and caressing his fur. She wanted to be on top--er, Iris wanted to love him once again.
"I'm too old to watch child pornography and get away with it," Hector jeered. The Martian posed like a scorpion and raced out the room.
"We're not kids, Hector!" Squosafina yelled out.
"Do you guys want some privacy? I heard Squoatlings get very...messy when mating," Chomsky asked. He was obviously embarrassed from witnessing the two of them in such an act.
"Chomsky, we're not--" Before Emmett could finish his statement, Josephine started to fondle his horns. "S-Stop it!"
Chomsky and Sanya looked at one another, equally feeling awkward.
"I'll bet 500 D's Emmett finishes first," Chomsky muttered, edging to the door. Sanya followed suit, locking the door as she reached it.
"You're really disgusting, Chomsk. But, I'll still raise you 600 D's Josephine does first." Seth just winked at the female Squoatling.
"Treat him nicely, you hear? He's mah boy...And Chomsky, I'll bet 6969 D's they both finish at the same time!" Squosafina rolled her eyes, smiling as they left.
> "You..."
"I what? I beat you?" Squemfet sighed and held her by the waist.
"You're such a bitch, you know that?" He smiled coyly, assuring her he did not mean what he said.
"If I'm a bitch, then I'm your bitch, you dick." Emmett chuckled at her response.
"You want me to get off, Squem?" Emmett shrugged, resting his head back once more. A long pause came afterwards.
"Speaking of dicks, you totally have an erection right now."
"What? No way."
"Yeah huh."
"No I don't!"
"Yes you do!" The two of them bickered back and forth, never actually getting anywhere with their conversation.
