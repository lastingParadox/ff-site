I'M A BIT LOUD?\n\noh. uh, sorry.\n\nAnyhow, hello, I'm Emmett, last known Squoatling here. I don't know where this broadcast is leading to, but I need to send this... At least for my own sake.\n\nI've been lost in space for about... A week now? After about... I don't know... [Noise, like the sound of pots and pans falling] Fuck, one moment. [Coughing and a pause] I think it has been roughly 2 GUYs since I've been in Llamanian captivity. I couldn't take it after their false promises. They mentioned a chance for my species to regrow, and all I received was... Grim news, to say the least. Waiting four years to empty your balls certainly takes a toll on the mental state. [Audible light chuckle] But uh... I sort of got upset and killed a few Llamanians, particularly General Llod and his cronies.\n\nThat was a dumb idea, and, out of fear, I left before anyone could catch me. I don't know if I'm a fugitive or not, or if I'm even in trouble. It's just that I'm losing hope. My family is god knows where and I'm all alone. Fuel in this pod ran out about a week ago and power levels are draining. [Long pause. You can hear a sigh and uneven breathing. It seems clear that Emmett was injured somehow.] I just want to survive and appease Squoat. I want to find another Squoatling, but I'm beginning to lose hope. This broadcast is all I have left, in hopes that someone will reach me. My current coordinates are -34.764, 2352.435, 7432.02 W in Sector B. I'm drifting... About 3.5 knots/per second directly in the X direction, give or take a 0.5 angle tolerance.\n\nI just need some help. Please."
