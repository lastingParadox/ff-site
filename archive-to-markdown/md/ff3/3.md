**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:38 PM)_

_Emmett gets up and licks Sanya's face._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:38 PM)_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:43 PM)_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:44 PM)_

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:47 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I'm thirsty.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:47 PM)_

_Emmett latched onto Sanya's foot._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:47 PM)_

> Emmett: Yourre not goin anywhere.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:48 PM)_

> Garrick: So picky.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:48 PM)_

> Emmett: You're staying wif me.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:48 PM)_

> Iris: And then when I get back I'll make, like, tacos or something.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:48 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, I'll go with you.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:48 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Wemmfort finds a glass bottle, breaks it, and eats the shards from the ground.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:48 PM)_

> Garrick: Too many crackheads here right now.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:49 PM)_

> Wemmfort: That was really refreshing.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:49 PM)_

> Emmett: I didn't take crack, Garrick.

_Emmett says this with a surprisingly elegant tone._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:49 PM)_

> Garrick: Grassheads, then.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:49 PM)_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:50 PM)_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:50 PM)_

_She lifts her leg so that she can talk to the goat better_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_

_Emmett was talking nonsense, it seemed._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya shake Emmett off of her?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_

_Sanya picks Emmett up by the back of his shirt_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:52 PM)_

_Emmett falls on his back, his mouth in a smirk._

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:52 PM)_

_Wemmfort throws some glass next to garrick._

_Sanya is unfazed._

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:53 PM)_
8ball should Wemmfort scrape Emmett off Sanya's leg?
(edited)

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 03:53 PM)_
Without a doubt :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:54 PM)_

_Emmett suddenly roundhouse kicks Sanya's stomach and hops out of her grasp._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:54 PM)_

> Sanya: Ow.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:54 PM)_

_Emmett was beginning to choke._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:56 PM)_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:57 PM)_

_Emmett was hitting himself in the stomach._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:57 PM)_

_The store isn't huge, but it's got a strangely wide variety of food._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_Sanya rolls away before disaster_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_The duo spend, like, 20 minutes trying to find normal meat._

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_Wemmfort starts to try to talk to emmett._

> Wemmfort: So, uh, you like glass?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_Emmett swallows, following with a visible twitch._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:58 PM)_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:59 PM)_

_Sanya hides behind the couch_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:59 PM)_

_Iris lifts up one of the strange meats._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:59 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:00 PM)_

> Garrick: Hope you're a good judge of food, because it all looks bad to me.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:00 PM)_

_Iris nods._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:00 PM)_

> Iris: If I weren't a ribbon dancer, I'd have been a chef.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:00 PM)_

_Emmett tackles onto Sanya, trying to pick her up._

> Emmett: I have brutal strength!

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:00 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I'm getting kinda hungry.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:00 PM)_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:00 PM)_

_Iris smiles at him._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:01 PM)_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:01 PM)_

> Iris: Thanks, that's really nice of you to say.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:01 PM)_

> Sanya: No you dont.

_She picks him up._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:01 PM)_

> Garrick: Yeah, sure.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:01 PM)_

> Emmett: What the fuck.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:01 PM)_

_She nods and goes to buy the mountain of food they picked up along the way._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:01 PM)_

> Emmett: How are you so strong?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:02 PM)_

_Sanya changes Emmett's physical properties and now he's a basketball_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:02 PM)_

> Garrick: You... have the money for all this, right?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:02 PM)_

_Iris pauses._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:02 PM)_

> Sanya: I was sent to assassinate a famous Basketball player, so i know a thing or two about THIS!

_She throws him into the kitchen_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_
Outlook not so good :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_

_Emmett braced for impact, but surprisingly, the impact wasn't too bad. He made a fake cracking noise and went dead silent._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_

> Iris: ...do you wanna just steal it?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_

_Garrick reaches into his pockets and pulls out 36._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_

> Garrick: Yes.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_

> Garrick: Good idea.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:04 PM)_

> Iris: Let's go.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:04 PM)_

> Sanya: I know you're not dead. That throw wasn't even strong enough to kill a 5 year old.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:04 PM)_

_The duo rushes out of the store, setting off alarms._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:04 PM)_

> Emmett: You fucking broke my arm though.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:04 PM)_

_Iris laughs._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:04 PM)_

> Sanya: Good. Breaking bones builds character.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:04 PM)_

> Iris: I've never stolen anything before! This is kinda fun.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:05 PM)_

_Sanya turns into a wizard and turns a random baby into a beer bottle_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:05 PM)_

> Garrick: Isn't it?? Nobody else gets the thrill!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:05 PM)_

_Emmett howled in pain to try and get more of a reaction._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:05 PM)_
8ball does a weird-looking crater attract the attention of Garrick

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:05 PM)_
Outlook good :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:05 PM)_

> Sanya: Nice howl. i give it a 6.5 ot of 10.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_
8ball do Iris and Garrick ride a shopping cart into the crater

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_
My sources say no :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_

> Sanya: You're drunk.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_

_Emmett turned his back on her._

> Emmett: I'm going to find some real ffriends.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_
8ball what

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_
Outlook not so good :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_

> Sanya: The only one out there... is Olag.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:07 PM)_
8ball do the ducks arrive at the crater at a similar time as the other two?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:07 PM)_
As I see it, yes :8ball:

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:07 PM)_
8baby

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:07 PM)_
8ball Does Garrick also see a pink blur in his peripheral vision?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:07 PM)_
It is decidedly so :8ball:

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:07 PM)_
No, you are poop.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:08 PM)_

_Emmett sighed._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:08 PM)_

> Emmett: Fine. You want me to tell you why I'mm sso drunk?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:08 PM)_

> Emmett: Or cann you tell?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:09 PM)_

> Sanya: Go ahead and tell me.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:09 PM)_
8poop

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:09 PM)_
No, you are poop.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:09 PM)_

_Emmett looked to the side, visibly embarrassed._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:09 PM)_

> Emmett: It's that time, y'know?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:10 PM)_
8ball 8poop

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:10 PM)_
Yes :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:10 PM)_
8ball do the two fall down the crater pit, leaving the groceries behind

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:10 PM)_
As I see it, yes :8ball:

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Iris: ow.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:11 PM)_

_The ducks arrive just in time to see the other two falling down into the crater_

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:11 PM)_

> Burner: Those weren't two people from the ship, were they?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:11 PM)_

_Emmett sat down next to Sanya, albeit sloppily._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Garrick: I'd call that a successful escape.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

_Diver quacks back_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

_Iris laughs._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

_Garrick looks up to see a figure looming above the hole._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Iris: I guess it was!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Emmett: I can't control it, you read up on Squoatling biology or wwhatevver.

**Sean** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

_Seth does the woah on minorities_

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Burner: So I guess we gotta go down, come on then

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

_The ducks begin to slowly fly down the crater_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:13 PM)_

_Iris also looks up._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Iris: That is... a long way back to the groceries.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Garrick: Well.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Garrick: We climbing?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_

_Iris shrugs._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Iris: I can climb.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Garrick: 'Cause I can get up there just fine.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_
8ball does wemmfort look for the ship?
(edited)

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_
As I see it, yes :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Garrick: That's no fun though.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_

_Emmett sat there, listening to the weirdos climbing a near-indefinitely deep crater._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Iris: Alright, what do you suggest?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:15 PM)_

_wemmfort searches frantically for the ship._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:15 PM)_

_Garrick looks over and sees that the hole goes deeper._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Garrick: I suggest we go that way.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:16 PM)_

_Iris considers it._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Sanya: I see. Have you tried murder? it works for me.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:16 PM)_

_The sound of flapping wings fills the cavern_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Emmett: Murrderr is wrong.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Garrick: Hey Sanya.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:17 PM)_

> Iris: If we could get back to the ship with the groceries before dinner, I don't see why not.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:17 PM)_

> Sanya: Yes, ghost?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:17 PM)_

> Emmett: I just really want to bang ssomething.

_Emmett muttered._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:17 PM)_

> Garrick: If you stop hearing from us, we died in a crater by the grocery store.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:17 PM)_

> Garrick: Come retrieve our bodies.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Emmett: Is Iris there?

**Sean** _(22-May-20 04:18 PM)_

_Seth pees, filling up the crater with piss_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Iris: Yeah, I'm here.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:19 PM)_

_Unfortunately, Seth ran out of pee eventually, only creating a 5" pool._

**Sean** _(22-May-20 04:20 PM)_

_seth starts to poop to fill in the gaps_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:20 PM)_

> Garrick: Gross, let's get outta here!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:20 PM)_

> Emmett: Can you guys get me some munchies or something?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:20 PM)_

_Iris nods in agreement._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:20 PM)_

> Iris: We bought a bunch of food already, we'll be back soon.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:21 PM)_

> Sanya: I can't really help you with that problem. Why not look around this trash heap for something to help?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:21 PM)_

> Emmett: That's just sick.

**Sean** _(22-May-20 04:21 PM)_

_Seth poops in every single one of Garrick's ears_

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:22 PM)_
square

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Iris: Let's get out of this crater.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett get really upset and leave?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_
Signs point to yes :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: Get awway from me.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Surely it's connected to another one somewhere. We just gotta find it.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm dissgusting.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

_Iris nods._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Iris: I'll follow you, then.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

_The ducks land and perch on the rocks, a few feet above the pair_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

_Sanya give a confused look at him._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Sanya: Are you alright?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Burner: You two good?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:24 PM)_

_Emmett runs off, frustrated and confused._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:25 PM)_
8ball do the two run off deeper into the cave

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:25 PM)_
Signs point to yes :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:25 PM)_

_Emmett is now inconveniently placed on the edge of the crater, due to him running away._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:25 PM)_

> Burner: They must have left their ears at home, Your call Diver

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Why did the Llamanians have to do thiss to me..

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:26 PM)_

_Diver starts running down the path after Iris and Garrick_

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:26 PM)_

> Burner: Of course you ran after them.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:26 PM)_

_Burner follows Diver_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:27 PM)_

_Sanya walks after her distressed friend._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:27 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm the only Squoatling left and I'm a ssad heap of trash.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:27 PM)_

_Iris hums while they walk through the cave._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:28 PM)_
(By the way everyone can hear the bumbling man)

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:28 PM)_

_Emmett leans in closer to the crater._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Emmett: I wonder how deep it goes.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:28 PM)_
8ball does the cavern begin to shake rapidly?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:28 PM)_
My sources say no :8ball:

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Iris: Very deep.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:29 PM)_

_Uncharacteristically, mostly because he's drunk and irrational_

> Emmett: Deep enough to end my missery?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Garrick: Watch out for whatever bugs might live in the trash.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Iris: no.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Iris: And yeah, I will.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:30 PM)_

_Wemmfort is still looking for the ship._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Emmett: I just wissh someone could understund or something.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_Diver jumps at Iris, knocking her to the ground_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_impact noise_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:31 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett fall down the pit?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:31 PM)_
Very doubtful :8ball:

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Burner: Diver, what the hell?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_Burner appears a bit behind them_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:32 PM)_

_Emmett lies down, his legs dangling over the pit._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:32 PM)_

_Diver quacks sadly and hops off Iris_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Iris: Hey, Diver.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

_Sanya passes by the grocery store, and notices the buggy._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

_Diver does a happy quack_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Sanya: This is ours, right?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

_Iris stands again, brushing herself off._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Burner: Oh, this is why you wanted to chase them, got it.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Emmett: Wonder how everyone would feel if I was gone. I mean, the GU wants me dead.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Iris: Yeah please take the groceries back to the ship for me.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Burner: What are you two even trying to find down here?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Garrick: Yeah, we left them up there in our escape.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Emmett: I'd just be giving into their demands.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll take them back to the ship.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Iris: A way out.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Iris: Also adventure, I think.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Burner: But couldn't he just float out and drop a rope for you?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:34 PM)_
8ball does Wemmfort give up?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:34 PM)_
Without a doubt :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Garrick: Can it, duck.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I give up.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

_Sanya, taking the cart, notices Emmett_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: Would the crew even care? Seth's even tried to kill me a few times and Sanya has a heart of stone.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Anyway, where is everybody?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Garrick: I'm just trying to find some excitement on this shithole asteroid we're stuck on.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

_Diver lowers his body and starts growling_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Iris: Hey, calm down guys.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: No one is even responding to me. Though, they may have be turned down.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I think I'm lost.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Garrick: Are you done, Emmett?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:36 PM)_

_Emmett's clearly sobered up by this point._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:36 PM)_

_Iris has Emmett turned down._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Emmett: Are there any stalagmites or something down there I can aim for?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Garrick: If you died, we'd have no pilot or acting captain.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Burner: Diver calm down, we need the ship to get off this place.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Garrick: You'd land in pee anyways.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

_Sanya walks over to the goat._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Emmett: Why is there piss down there?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Sanya: What are you doing?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

_Wemmfort lays on the ground, feeling upset._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Garrick: Divine intervention.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

_Diver straightens up and returns to his normal self_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

_Emmett turns around._

> Emmett: Oh, hey.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Emmett: What do you want?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:38 PM)_

_Iris sighs, gesturing to the trash cave._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:38 PM)_

_She picks him up and puts him in the shopping cart._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Iris: Should we go now?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Sanya: Talk to me. What's wrong?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm your plaything, that's one thing that's wrong.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:39 PM)_
8ball does Iris find a usable flashlight among the trash

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:39 PM)_
Don't count on it :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:39 PM)_

_Emmett crosses his arms._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Sanya: That doesn't normally bother you. You're just hiding behind small issues.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Iris: Can we just... keep going?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Iris: Please?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_
8ball Up ahead in the crater, are there booby traps?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_
My reply is no :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_
8ball does the group come across booby traps

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_
My reply is no :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Emmett: Small issues?!

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Burner: Yeah we should, let me and Diver lead, we can see in the dark. Kinda

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Emmett: My whole race is dead!

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:41 PM)_

> Iris: Okay.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:41 PM)_

> Sanya: And there is the big issue.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:41 PM)_

> Emmett: The whole GU wants me captured and potentially murdered!

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:41 PM)_

_Iris turns Emmett up a little, enough to catch what he's saying from time to time._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:41 PM)_

_Burner moves to the front, Diver a little bit behind her_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:41 PM)_

> Emmett: The llamanians want to decapitate me and make my head their mantlepiece!

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Sanya: Now, is me being playful really bothering you compared to that?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Iris: Garrick are you coming?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Emmett: ... No.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Garrick: Yeah, sorry, I just thought I heard something from behind us.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Emmett: It just makes me feel less masculine.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:43 PM)_

_He catches up._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:43 PM)_
8ball do the ducks find a large, open cavern filled with ruins?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:43 PM)_
Yes :8ball:

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Wemmfort: What do I do?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Just lay here, hopelessly?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Iris: Wow.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_
he was looking for the ship

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Burner: Hopefully theres an exit somewhere

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Sanya: Then it's a small issue. If you want to talk about everything, don't say that the small things are bothering you.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Sanya: You have to start with the big things.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Iris: This is so cool.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Burner: I doubt anything would settle down here without at least one surface exit

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

_Iris goes ahead a bit, wandering around the ruins in amazement._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Garrick: Weird... who would want to settle down here?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm pretty irrational when I'm hard as a boulder.

_Emmett still hasn't remembered to turn off his comms._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Burner: I can scan the area hold on

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Sanya: Comms are on. Might not want to talk about that.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Iris: Gross, Emmett.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:46 PM)_

_Burner takes flight and starts scanning the cavern, this leaves Diver alone, poking through rubble with his beak_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:47 PM)_

> Iris: See anything cool, Diver?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:47 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya start putting the groceries up?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:47 PM)_
Yes, definitely :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:47 PM)_

_Emmett paused for a moment and turned off his comm._

> Emmett: I mean, it really isn't that much of an issue when most of the crew has seen me naked.

_He was clearly trying to push off his embarrassment._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:47 PM)_

_Diver looks over and quacks, then keeps trying to dig something out_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:47 PM)_

_Sanya puts Emmett on the counter and starts to put up groceries._

> Sanya: I guess that's right.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:48 PM)_

_Iris heads over and helps him dig._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:48 PM)_

_Emmett, playing along, kicks his legs as he's on the counter._

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:48 PM)_
8ball does wemmfort get up?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:48 PM)_
You may rely on it :8ball:

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:49 PM)_
8ball booby traps?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:49 PM)_
Outlook good :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:49 PM)_

> Sanya: I understand what you mean. Things are hard for you.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:49 PM)_

_wemmfort gets up_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:49 PM)_

> Emmett: But yeah, I drank and drank and drank to try and hide this... "Hardness". Clearly didn't work.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:49 PM)_

_Muffled beeping starts to play._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:50 PM)_

_Iris' eyes widen and she reels back._

> Iris: Diver get away from there!

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:50 PM)_

> Garrick: Back up!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:50 PM)_

> Emmett: I never had this experience, you know.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:50 PM)_

_Diver, being incredibly stubborn, refuses to move away_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:51 PM)_

> Sanya: What, pain or horny?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:51 PM)_

> Emmett: No real grocery stores or family facilities on Vortox-56.

_Emmett ignored her response._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:51 PM)_

_Iris tries to scoop up Diver and take him away from the bomb._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:51 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, the counter.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:52 PM)_

_The pile of trash explodes, with Iris and Diver barely being caught in the blast._

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:52 PM)_

_Wemmfort walks towards the sun, because that's where he assumes they are.\*\*He ends up getting even more lost._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:52 PM)_

> Emmett: Are you still on your comms?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:52 PM)_
t!roll d20

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:52 PM)_

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:53 PM)_
Wemmfort can speak youtube

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:53 PM)_

> Iris: Ouch!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:53 PM)_
8ball Does the A Plot involve the cheese ruins, wherein at its heart lies the king, Biggus Cheesus?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:53 PM)_
As I see it, yes :8ball:

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:53 PM)_

_the explosion brings Burner down from flight_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:53 PM)_

> Iris: Are you okay?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:53 PM)_

_Iris looks worriedly down at Diver._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:54 PM)_

> Garrick: Are YOU okay? Those burns look bad!

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:54 PM)_

> Iris: I've had worse.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:54 PM)_

> Burner: Diver are you okay?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:54 PM)_

_Diver quacks, sounding a little dazed_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

_Emmett smiled softly, slowly forgetting his frustrations._

> Emmett: Are we done shopping yet, Plant-squom?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_
🤔 | [RP]retribution, I pick med kit

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

> Sanya: Sure.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

> Burner: Wait, why the FUCK were you not using your armor?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

> Garrick: Lucky!

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

_Garrick pulls out a med kit from his pockets._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

> Garrick: I don't know how to use any of this!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:56 PM)_

> Emmett: You were supposed to say that we were almost finished despite having a million groceries left.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:56 PM)_

_Diver quacks in response_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:56 PM)_

_Iris laughs, though it sounds pretty strained._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:56 PM)_

> Iris: I do.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:56 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh. Why?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:56 PM)_

> Burner: What do you mean you didn't think it would be a landmine?!

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:56 PM)_

_Wemmfort stumbles on the ground from stress on his back and coughs._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:57 PM)_

> Burner: What were you expecting? A lottery ticket?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:57 PM)_

_Garrick is still paranoid._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:57 PM)_

> Garrick: Emmett, did you happen to see anyone else down here when you were brooding earlier?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:59 PM)_
8ball did the explosion reveal a tunnel?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:59 PM)_
Most likely :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:59 PM)_
emet

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:59 PM)_

_Emmett's comms are off._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:59 PM)_

_Iris examines her arms with a grimace._

> Iris: That's gonna make it hard to make dinner.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:59 PM)_

_Diver quacks and points with a wing towards a newly opened tunnel_

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:00 PM)_
I am zander 2 in dotishtale

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:00 PM)_

> Burner: Okay, you found a way out, I'll give you that. Just don't be a dumbass next time.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:00 PM)_

> Garrick: Sanya. Ask Emmett if we were followed.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:00 PM)_

_Iris stands, stumbling a bit but catching herself._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:00 PM)_

_The pink blurr is more apparent._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:01 PM)_

_Garrick looks back again, but finds nothing behind them._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:01 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett, Garrick is asking if you saw anything while brooding.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:01 PM)_

> Emmett: It's like an Earth family thing. Seth told me of how children don't really like to shop-

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:01 PM)_

> Garrick: This is new. I've never been so paranoid like this before.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:01 PM)_

> Sanya: You might want to turn your comms back on.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:01 PM)_

> Emmett: I can't recall.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:01 PM)_

> Burner: Wait how many of us are there?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:02 PM)_

> Iris: Uh... four, I think.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:02 PM)_

> Emmett: And no, I like what we have here.

_Emmett hopped in the cart again._

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:02 PM)_
My reply is no :8ball:

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:02 PM)_

> Burner: Well uh, there are 7 living creatures down here, according to my scan.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya return the Cart?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_
Yes :8ball:

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_

_Iris laughs nervously._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_

_A sudden flash occurred within the ruins, akin to a picture being taken._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_

> Sanya: C'mon. We're returning this.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_

> Emmett: What, you want me to walk?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_

_Sanya starts the walk to the crater with Emmett in the cart._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_

> Garrick: WHO'S THERE?

_Garrick snaps back around._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:04 PM)_

_The ducks' armor immediately snap shut_

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:04 PM)_

> Burner: What the fuck was that?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:04 PM)_

_Garrick pulls out a laser pistol._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:04 PM)_

_Iris smiles nervously._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:04 PM)_

> Iris: Am I the only one here with a lot of enemies, or...?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:05 PM)_

_Diver begins growling loudly_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:05 PM)_

_She pulls out her dagger._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:05 PM)_

_Garrick somehow had some moisture on him, as if something gave him a quick and sloppy lick._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:05 PM)_

> Garrick: Come out! I'll-

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:06 PM)_
8ball do the people come out

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:06 PM)_
My sources say no :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:06 PM)_

_Garrick shudders, clearly shocked that he was somehow touched._

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:06 PM)_
He's lost

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:06 PM)_

> Emmett: "Garrrrick...."

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:06 PM)_

> Iris: Garrick are you okay?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:07 PM)_

_Garrick looks around, pointing his gun outwards, trying to find the source._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:07 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, you should seriously see my hooves.

_Emmett, bored from Sanya's idleness, pushed his feet in her face._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:07 PM)_

> Garrick: Come on! I'll take you on!

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:08 PM)_

_Burner's rifle pops out_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:08 PM)_

> Emmett: "Oh... how quaint..."

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:08 PM)_

> Sanya: I'm trying to steer this thing to the crater. I can't do that with your hooves in my face.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:08 PM)_

_A vacuum cleaner turns on in the distance._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:08 PM)_

> Burner: When the ghost is losing it, you know something bad is happening

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:08 PM)_

_Iris holds her dagger steady, eyes scanning for danger._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:08 PM)_

> Iris: This could be worse.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:09 PM)_

> Emmett: Have you ever admired my hooves though? They're very smooth. I take care of them diligently.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:09 PM)_

> Iris: We could have no idea how to get out of here.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:09 PM)_

> Emmett: "I've been watching you for a loooooooong time."

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:09 PM)_

> Burner: Lets get the ghost back then get out of here, I'm in no mood for a fight

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:09 PM)_

> Sanya: That's great Emmett, please get them out of my face.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:10 PM)_

> Garrick: What's your deal? Did I rob you or something?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:10 PM)_

> Iris: Garrick we should go.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:10 PM)_

> Garrick: If you've got a grudge, we can settle it right now!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:10 PM)_

_Emmett got them out of her face and rested them on her shoulders, his horns propping him atop of the grate of the shopping cart._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:10 PM)_

> Emmett: "What do you want most in life, ghost?"

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:11 PM)_

> Burner: Gary, we need to go.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:11 PM)_

_Garrick has an arrogant look on his face._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:11 PM)_

> Garrick: Right now, I want you to piss off.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:12 PM)_
8ball does wemmfort sink into the ground and find the crew?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:12 PM)_
Without a doubt :8ball:

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:12 PM)_

_Iris sighs helplessly._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:12 PM)_

> Iris: Y'know what? Screw it.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:13 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm really a work of art.

_Emmett tossed his shirt at Sanya's face, the cart nearing the crater._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:13 PM)_
8ball do they come out yet

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:13 PM)_
Yes :8ball:

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:13 PM)_

> Burner: Anyone else see the person COMING OUT OF THER FUCKING WALL?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:13 PM)_

_Wemmfort sinks into the trash-ridden ground, and is now where his crew members are._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_
8ball Does the pink being reveal herself?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_
Very doubtful :8ball:

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Iris: You get used to it!

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Sanya: Put your shirt back on.

_She throws it back at him_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Emmett: "Come on. Guess who it is."

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Emmett: Paint me, plant woman.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Burner: You! From the wall! Identify yourself!

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Let me guess. korbo? the pink guy who sucks people for money?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Garrick: You expect me to remember all the names of my targets?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:15 PM)_

> Sanya: I can't paint. Art was never a strong suit.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:15 PM)_

_Iris snorts._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:15 PM)_

_Emmett looked down at his chest, regaining a bit of his self-confidence._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:15 PM)_

> Iris: Hey, guys... weren't there three extra people in here?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:16 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, what would you do if I threw my pants at you?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:16 PM)_

> Burner: I think we just found one

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:16 PM)_

> Sanya: Throw them away and make you go naked.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:16 PM)_

> Burner: Two more apparently

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Emmett: I mean, you'd want to put the crew at risk of getting distracted by my hot bod?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Burner: We still don't know if Mr.Wall is friendly or not, do we?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_
8ball does Garrick start shooting sporadically

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_
Without a doubt :8ball:

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Iris: Please don't let any of them be from the group that blew up my planet.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Sanya: You might catch some unwanted attention.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Emmett: "Oh come on, Garrick. I'll give you a hint."

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Burner: Get to cover he's actually lost it!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:18 PM)_

_The being flashed ahead of him._

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:18 PM)_
Came out of the floor, actually

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:18 PM)_

_The ducks dive for cover_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:18 PM)_

> Emmett: "I'm a ghost too!"

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:18 PM)_
8ball does the monster reveal itself to the others?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:18 PM)_
My reply is no :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:19 PM)_

_Emmett tossed his pants at Sanya, seriously trying to get her to mess with him._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:19 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya & Cart fall into the pit?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:19 PM)_
As I see it, yes :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:19 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, that narrows it down, but I don't remember any pink ghosts!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:19 PM)_

> Emmett: "And I have a clubhouse, Garrick."

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:19 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett, you-

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:19 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Is he still drunk?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:20 PM)_

> Iris: Garrick we cant fight ghosts like you can, we need to go.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:20 PM)_

_Emmett is startled by the sudden descent and he latches onto Sanya._

> Emmett: Sanya, aim for that cushiony area!

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Garrick: Then get outta here!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Emmett: "You joined it when we were just little kids."

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

_Iris rolls her eyes._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Garrick: Now I know someone's following me.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Iris: Like I'm just gonna leave without you.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Emmett: "And I've been trying to find you ever since."

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

_Sanya lands in the soft spot with a thud, despite it being soft._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Sanya: Ow.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:22 PM)_

> Garrick: That doesn't even make any sense!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:22 PM)_

> Emmett: "You didn't receive your reward!"

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:22 PM)_

> Burner: At this point we should just go

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:22 PM)_

> Sanya: Hey, we fell, where are you?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:23 PM)_
8ball is wemmfort here with everyone?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:23 PM)_
My sources say no :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:23 PM)_

_Emmett was shivering from the depths._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:23 PM)_

> Iris: backup, we need immediate backup.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:23 PM)_

> Sanya: Then tell us where you are.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:23 PM)_

> Emmett: I swear, I choose the worst times to mess around.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:24 PM)_

> Burner: If we're staying can we at least know what's causing the ghost to go mad?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:24 PM)_
8ball does Iris suddenly have the ability to punch ghosts

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:24 PM)_
Yes, definitely :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:24 PM)_
8ball Does the being now reveal herself to Garrick?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:24 PM)_
Outlook not so good :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:24 PM)_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:25 PM)_

> Iris: Forward! We're forward!

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:25 PM)_

> Sanya: Come on, Emmett. We're heading down the cave.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:25 PM)_

_wemmfort figures out that he in fact isn't with the crew. The fake crew reveals themselves as bemmit, shangya, Lyrus, Deevrr, Burngner, and Garry Hickman._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:25 PM)_

_The pink ghost shows herself to Garrick, with a visible Mickey Mouse mask and all._

> Emmett: "It's yo' boy, Gretta!"

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:25 PM)_

_Sanya grabs Emmett and starts running._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm f-freezing!

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Wemmfort: You people are incorrect.

_Wemmfort starts to find the real crew._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Garrick: What's your problem??

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Garrick: What do you want from me?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Sanya: Next time, keep your clothes on.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Sanya: We're nearly there.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:27 PM)_

> Emmett: "I love you Garrick! I always have!"

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:27 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I might have swallowed some grass while coming down here.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:27 PM)_

_The ducks have moved to the tunnel entrance waiting to see what happens next_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:27 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, at least you answered and stopped being cryptic.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:27 PM)_

> Emmett: Well, I still am a little tipsy. I hid it well from you though.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:27 PM)_

> Iris: Oh, that's an unexpected twist.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:27 PM)_

_Sanya and a naked Emmett arrive to meet the rest of the crew._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Emmett: Plus, I didn't think you were such a reckless cart driver!

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Sanya: Sorry, what did we miss?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Emmett: Let me push you around like a kid!

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Iris: Yeah but who was the other person?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:28 PM)_

_wemmfort falls on the ground and hallucinates himself convulsing into the air._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Sanya: Reckless? I couldn't see! Your pants were in my face!

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:28 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:29 PM)_

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:30 PM)_
8ball does Garrick have explosive nerf darts in his pocket dimension?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:30 PM)_
Very doubtful :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:30 PM)_

_Garrick tries to shoot at the other ghost, but it shoots a foam bullet instead._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:33 PM)_

_The fuck is happening?_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:34 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:35 PM)_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:35 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, you want to go grab some food or something?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:35 PM)_

> Iris: ...yeah that's why I'm asking Garrick for permission.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:35 PM)_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:37 PM)_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:38 PM)_
8ball Is the tunnel marked, in Olag's writing, "EXIT"?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:38 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:39 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:39 PM)_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:39 PM)_

_Iris does so._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:39 PM)_

_Emmett hopped onto Sanya. He said this in a slightly sarcastic voice._

> Emmett: Sorry for getting super sad and stuff and getting us stuck down here.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:40 PM)_
8ball does Iris pick off whatever was stuck onto his vest?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:40 PM)_
Outlook good :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:40 PM)_
8ball Does the pink ghost suddenly open her pocket dimension, creating a vacuum?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:40 PM)_
My sources say no :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:40 PM)_

> Sanya: We'll just head to the ship. We'll wait for you to be done here.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:40 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:40 PM)_

_Garrick sighs in relief._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:41 PM)_

> Emmett: "I WILL EAT YOU. WE WILL BE ONE."

_The pink ghost opens its mouth, it opening by about a fourth of a foot each second._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:41 PM)_

_Iris punches the ghost._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:41 PM)_

_The pink ghost inhales as Iris punches her._

_The ghost turns around, unfazed._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:43 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:44 PM)_

_Garrick shoots her again._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:44 PM)_

> Garrick: You can be again once we get rid of her.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:45 PM)_

> Sanya: Yeah, I understand. But hey, at least we don't have to deal with whatever that was.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:45 PM)_

> Garrick: Surely someone else has a spectral weapon, right? Nobody has secretly wanted me dead?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:45 PM)_

_The ducks get tired of waiting, and against their better judgement leave the crew to the ghosts in order to search for something to bring on the ship_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:45 PM)_

> Iris: I can punch ghosts.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:45 PM)_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:46 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:46 PM)_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:46 PM)_
8ball Does the pink ghost start to consume Iris?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:47 PM)_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:47 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:47 PM)_

_Garrick is still trying to shoot the pink ghost._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:47 PM)_

_Emmett hears Iris from Sanyas comms and spoke loudly._

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:47 PM)_
My reply is no :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:48 PM)_

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:50 PM)_
Most likely :8ball:
