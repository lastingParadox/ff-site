I don't think so.

Yes, definitely.

**FFBot** _(21-Apr-20 11:56 AM)_
Very doubtful.

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 11:56 AM)_
(Scars can heal, as can wounds; the question was stupid.)

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 11:56 AM)_
8ball Did Emmett party until he was extremely drunk last night?

**FFBot** _(21-Apr-20 11:56 AM)_
My sources say no.

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 11:57 AM)_

Flip a coin with 8coin. Heads is yes, tails is no.

8ball How about now?

**FFBot** _(21-Apr-20 11:58 AM)_
Concentrate and ask again.

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 11:58 AM)_
8ball I'm asking again.

We stole a part of their ship with whatever was in it

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:09 PM)_
Emmett makes sure that that chunk is big enough to require an entire GUY's worth of fixing to replace

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:09 PM)_
So it is HUGE.

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:09 PM)_
Like, the space yachi is having to tote something that is almost bigger than it

Dakari is such a good mercenary that he avoided all damage

Oh, sorry

**Brody** _(21-Apr-20 12:12 PM)_
I don't think she was

8ball Did the Llamanians almost capture Emmett during the experience?

**FFBot** _(21-Apr-20 12:15 PM)_
Signs point to yes.

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:15 PM)_
Very strange how they only scratched him. Hmm....

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:15 PM)_
8ball Before he left with the others, did the Llamanians grab a patch of his fur?

**FFBot** _(21-Apr-20 12:16 PM)_
Most likely.

**Rashidi** _(21-Apr-20 12:16 PM)_
Dakari is an amazing mercenary

**Rashidi** _(21-Apr-20 12:16 PM)_
No wonder you hired him

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:18 PM)_
@Brody#ff-media

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:18 PM)_
Unless you had other plans

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:18 PM)_
So currently there are five rooms to accommodate for the nine crew members that once were on the ship

**Brody** _(21-Apr-20 12:20 PM)_
I did have plans for Mary, she was really only going to be in short stories

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)_
Seth, with his own; Sanya, Emmett, Chomsky, Jim, Maia, Garrick, Iris, Hector, and Chase

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)_
Wait

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)_
That's ten

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)_
So after Maia and Chomsky left, that remained 8

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)_
I'm sure everyone would want to shift their rooms around due to the crew additions/leavings
(edited)

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)_
The chunk of ship from the Llamanians will be able to accommodate for 4 more rooms
(edited)

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)_
Plus storage and potentially another engine.

**Brody** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
Yeah

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
But for the time being, who's sharing with who? (Before the new additions)

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
We'd have two free slots

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
Chase, Iris, and Jim left eventually

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
So that's 5

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
hector went back to Mars

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
So no one is sharing rooms currently

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
Four people

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
Seth, Sanya, Emmett, Garrick

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
I'm sure Chomsky is coming back

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
@Jonas

Emmett, from his culture's perspective, is roughly 21, but from the GU's perspective, is 24.

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:30 PM)_
Let's move

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 06:48 PM)_
@deleted-roleAfter Emmett was welcomed back into the crew, he was devastated. He had spent an entire GUY under the effects of believing that he had a Squoatling wife. He had completely forgotten and forgiven Seth for airlocking him; he wanted vengeance for the Llamanians giving him a dream and them crushing it. For roughly two GUYs, he researched and steadily made a plan to ransack the Llamanian mothership, wanting to make a message that he was not someone to mess with. He didn't want to kill them off either, as he believed that they were still people under the effects of an abusive rule as opposed to monsters. He and the crew hired hundreds of mercenaries to get them into the ship and raid, with many of them being hired to be cannon fodder.
Anyhow, the day before the current episode was the day of the raid. While Emmett planned on killing a few Llamanians and stealing some of their machinery, the crew somehow stole a chunk of the mothership that was almost the size of their own ship. The original crew left with little damage, aside from Seth breaking his leg. All that was left from the assault was a chunk of Emmett's fur, taken from the back of his neck.

The current episode was the aftermath of their celebration, when Emmett got pretty drunk and Seth took on an army of ladies. Currently, everyone is asleep, Chomsky, Iris, and Dakari are sleeping in the living block (main area/hangout room), and the holovision is on, but showing static.

The Anole and the Alternion are currently at a space station. The crew is pretty low on fuel and food, but should be able to make it to the spacestation, given they want to fly there. The weekly GU broadcast, which showcases important news and announcements, is meant to broadcast soon.
