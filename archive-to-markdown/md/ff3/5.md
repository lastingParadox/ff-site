**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_
No, you are poop.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_
It's been a week or so after the first episode. The crew has been pretty alright, for the most part, but Garrick and Sanya have been trying to keep Emmett out of trouble. That's all I can think of.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 03:58 PM)_

_Vargas wakes up._

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

_Garrick is currently digging in the fridge, because Trey is a water bottle._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

> Emmett: Garrick.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

> Garrick: Emmett.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

> Emmett: Can you please stop stealing from the ship?

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

_Vargas goes gets a snack felling light-headed._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

> Emmett: We're pretty low on supplies.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

> Vargas: Hey guys.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

> Garrick: Why don't we get supplies then? I'm hungry.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_
8ball does Emmett say the asriel voice blip

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_
It is certain.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Vargas: Ill go with.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

_Emmett was somehow upset by even this little statement. He was also upset at the random intruder._

> Emmett: Remind me, why do we have this guy on the ship?> Emmett: ah

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Vargas: If it's ok.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett take out his holo-device and set it up?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_
NOOOOOO!

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

> Garrick: We had some people stow away here the other day, and apparently nobody cared, so they're still here.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

> Emmett: Let me check the holonet for bounties. You know. Doing what we actually should be doing?

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

> Vargas: Hey we can work together then.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

> Vargas: What do you say?

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_
8ball Does Matthias sit down and eat a loaf of sourdough bread?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_
Yigga.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

> Emmett: Work together for what?

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm just checking bounties.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

> Vargas: Bounties.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

_Emmett sighs audibly and checks online._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:05 PM)_
8ball does Emmet take a liking to Vargas?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:05 PM)_
Majority rules! Vote on it!

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:06 PM)_

> Emmett: Come over here, ghost-boy.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:06 PM)_

> Vargas: ?????

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_

_Garrick heads over, annoyed by the nickname._

**Preston** _(01-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_
8ball Is Volonta currently cleaning?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_
Signs point to no.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_

> Emmett: Don't get sassy with me. I'm your superior. Or whatever.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_

> Emmett: Now look here.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_

> Emmett: There's a bounty out for Richard Jamerez. Apparently a lot of ducketts on the line for him.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:09 PM)_

> Vargas: How much?

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:09 PM)_
garrick annoyed face:

**Unknown** _(01-Jun-20 04:09 PM)_
8ball does richard know there are those that seek to end him?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:09 PM)_
My sources say no.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:10 PM)_

> Vargas: Is the bounty?

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:10 PM)_

> Emmett: Uh...

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:10 PM)_

> Emmett: There's a range.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:10 PM)_

> Emmett: 75,000 to 150,000, depending on how sloppy we are.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:11 PM)_

> Vargas: I'll help if you let me join your crew. What do you say?

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:13 PM)_

> Emmett: Uh.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:13 PM)_

> Emmett: Do we have any extra beds?

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:13 PM)_

> Vargas: Think about all the money i make technically goes to you.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:14 PM)_

> Garrick: You can sleep in the pool.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:14 PM)_

> Vargas: I'll buy my own barracks.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:14 PM)_

> Emmett: This isn't your ship.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:14 PM)_

_Emmett furrowed his brow._

> Emmett: Since you desperately want to join _my_ crew, you need to follow _my_ rules.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:15 PM)_

> Vargas: Ok.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:15 PM)_

_Emmett's arms visibly shook._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:16 PM)_

> Vargas: Should I come back at another time?

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:16 PM)_
8ball does vargas have a trillion duckets?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:17 PM)_
Ґɍ:medical_symbol: (Yes).

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:17 PM)_

> Vargas: I can pay for everything.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:17 PM)_
8ball Aren't Vargas's ducketts all counterfeit, aside from about 100,000?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:17 PM)_
My sources say no.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:18 PM)_
8ball Aren't Vargas's ducketts all counterfeit, aside from about 10,000?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:18 PM)_
Sí.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:19 PM)_

> Vargas: I can pay for everything myself.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:19 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth.

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:19 PM)_

_Seth awakes_

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:19 PM)_

> Seth: What?

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:19 PM)_

_Emmett speaks into the comms._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:19 PM)_

> Emmett: Get in here.

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:19 PM)_

> Seth: Why?

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:20 PM)_

> Emmett: We may have a bounty.

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:20 PM)_

> Seth: ok.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:20 PM)_

_Emmett turns into Squasriel for 2 seconds._

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:20 PM)_

_Seth rises from his bed_

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:20 PM)_

> Emmett: Also... 8ball head, what would you pay for?

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:20 PM)_

> Seth: Coming.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_

> Vargas: My barracks to be built and food for a month.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_

> Emmett: Problem is, this is our ship.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_

> Emmett: And I don't want a barracks.

_Emmett slammed his hoof down on the table._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

> Vargas: I meant my room not literal barracks.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

_Vargas laughed under his breath._

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Garrick: I really think you're missing out on the opportunity to sleep in the pool.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: Please don't test me.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm under a lot of physical stress right now.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Vargas: I'm sorry.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Emmett's in a bit of a funk right now. Don't bother him.

_Garrick whispers to Vargas._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_

> Vargas: Yeah. I'll leave him alone.

_Vargas whispers to Garrick._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_

_Emmett sighed and opened one of the cabinets. He notices a batch of grass._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett reach for the grass?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_
Da.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_

> Emmett: Maybe just a bite...

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_

> Garrick: no

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_

_Garrick whispers "No" into Emmett's ears._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

_Mateo stops eating the sourdough and stared at Emmett._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

> Emmett: No.
> Emmett: Dude! Reverb!

_Emmett tosses the grass in surprise._
8ball Does Mateo grab the grass and stick it in his pocket?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_
As I see it, yes.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Emmett: You made me drop it!
> Emmett: You're not having this.
> Emmett: Why?
> Emmett: I don't even know you!
> Emmett: Clearly, it's addictive.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Garrick: Whatever works.

_Garrick takes the grass from Mateo's pockets and puts them in HIS pockets._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

\*\*

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Emmett: I've seen too many good people lost to anything like this.
> Emmett: It's just grass. Eat it.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Vargas: STOOOOOOOP!!!!!!!!! NOW!

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_

> Emmett: Mateo.

_Emmett didn't notice Garrick's stealing._

> Emmett: I'm not giving that a shot.
> Emmett: That's what everyone says.
> Emmett: It's not a drug.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_
8ball does Vargas become a crew member for good?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_
You decide. You earned it!

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_

> Emmett: It's literally a primary producer.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_

> Emmett: The cornerstone of life.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_
8ball does Garrick eat the grass

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_
Ґɍ:medical_symbol: (Yes).

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_

> Emmett: Are you thinking heavily about eating it again?
> Emmett: I don't need it! Quite dictating my life!

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Garrick: Look like grass. Smell like grass.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Vargas: STOOOOP!!! Throw away the grass. NOW!

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Emmett: If you don't need it, why do you want it so badly?

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

_Garrick pockets Vargas._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Vargas: Give it to me.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Emmett: It just comforts me.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Emmett: Now please.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Emmett: Give it back.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

_Vargas slaps Garrick._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Vargas: You tried to rob me!

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

_Vargas ultimately fails, because slapping the wall does nothing_

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

_Vargas says muffled._

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Garrick: You can come out once you stop being annoying.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Garrick: Nothing personal, it happens with every stowaway.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm not sure if I should.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

> Emmett: Let me think about it.

_Emmett does his trademark goat eyes trick._

> Emmett: Please?

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:33 PM)_

> Seth: here.

**Unknown** _(01-Jun-20 04:33 PM)_

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:33 PM)_
N.

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:33 PM)_

_Seth arrives where all the crew are_

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

_Garrick finally lets go of Vargas before he suffocates him to death._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

_Emmett pays no mind to Seth entering, waiting for @Zander @Zander to respond._@Zander@Zander

> Emmett: No.
> Emmett: Like I said, I need to think on it.
> Emmett: As should you.
> Emmett: I have thought about it!
> Emmett: Think about if you can actually go without it.
> Emmett: I LITERALLY CANNOT.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Garrick: Þ?Ǽɷ/ЊݛЊɍԗ$.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

_Emmett's mouth trembled._

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

_Seth offers a cig to Garrick_

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

_Garrick politely accepts_

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Emmett: Squoat called it some grass disorder. Fetal Grass Syndrome?

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

_Seth produces a lighter and lights his cig_

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Vargas: I'm sorry for stomping up to you Seth.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Emmett: Probably means your parents did it alot.

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Seth: Ok.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Emmett: Yeah. I desperately need it or I'm going to die. The last Squoatling's death will be on your hands.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

_Vargas says full of guilt._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

_Emmett was clearly overreacting._

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Garrick: Squoat also said you should get off of it.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Emmett: Is that what the voice in your head is telling you?

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Garrick: Maybe he changed his mind.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Emmett: Yeah... He changed his mind...

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

_Garrick pulls out a stick of Shock Chewing Gum and hands it to Emmett._

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Garrick: Try this instead.

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_
8ball Does Seth hand Emmett a grass blunt?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_
NOOOOOO!

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_

_A piercingly loud screech could be heard from his head._

> Emmett: "I DID NOT CHANGE MY MIND. GET OFF IT."

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

> Garrick: Whoa, was THAT him?

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

> Seth: Head?

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

> Seth: Mic?

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

> Seth: Speaker?

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

_Emmett's ears were popping. He took the shock gum and bit into the wrapper hard._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

> Vargas: Phone?

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

> Garrick: Wait! I just realized what that was!

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Vargas: Can I get some comms now?

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Seth: No.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

_Emmett shook from the combined efforts of the shock and the loud ass speaker in his head. He tried to cover his ears._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Vargas: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

_Vargas laughs watching from the side_

> Vargas: HAHAHAHAHHAHA.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:41 PM)_

> Emmett: Seems like your God isn't too happy with your choices.

_Emmett was temporarily deaf._

> Emmett: WHAT?!

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:42 PM)_

> Vargas: HI.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:42 PM)_

8ball does Garrick wrap Emmett's head in a Towel

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:42 PM)_
Sad to tell you that it does not happen.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:42 PM)_

_Garrick instead sits and ignores Emmett._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:43 PM)_

_Soon, he could hear again._

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:43 PM)_

_Seth grabs Emmett and starts to carry him_

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:46 PM)_

8ball does vargas get to do whatever he wants as long as it helps the crew?
