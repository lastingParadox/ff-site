_Olag has finally finished his expansion onto the ship, fixing all of the engine problems as well. Unfortunately, a lot of the Llamanian spaceship had to be scrapped. In total, we have now 6 crew rooms and finally an jacuzzi. Olag is currently waiving their fee in exchange for a kiss from his crush._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:36 PM)_

_Emmett folds his arms._

> Emmett: No, you faggot.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:36 PM)_

> Seth: "ahaha"

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:36 PM)_

> Seth: "I'll just be taking payment then."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:37 PM)_

> Emmett: How much?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:37 PM)_

> Emmett: I have cash to spare.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:38 PM)_

> Seth: "So, for the expansion, the repairs, and the work it'll be uhhhhh"

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:38 PM)_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:38 PM)_

_Emmett widens his eyes._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:38 PM)_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:39 PM)_

> Seth: "Correct"

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:39 PM)_

> Sanya: That feels a bit shady. Do repairs normally cost that much?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:39 PM)_

> Seth: "I also included a safety fee"

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:39 PM)_

> Emmett: No!

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:39 PM)_

> Seth: "Considering I'm hiding you guys here while you're being chased by bounty hunters and the GU."

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 03:40 PM)_
I thought we were waiting for Rashidi

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:40 PM)_

_Emmett looked back at Sanya._

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 03:41 PM)_
8ball Does Wemmfort see that some jars are missing from under the sink?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 03:41 PM)_
My sources say no.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:41 PM)_

> Sanya: You have to.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:41 PM)_

> Seth: "I was told that Seth had money"

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:41 PM)_

> Seth: I do.

**Preston** _(26-May-20 03:41 PM)_

> Volentina: I only have two.. uh, duckies?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:41 PM)_

> Seth: Emmett, go grab the racer guy's credit card.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:42 PM)_

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:42 PM)_

_Rachell is in the back ground poking holes into the ground, she seems extremely bored._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:42 PM)_

_Emmett races over to the unconscious racecar driver and takes his credit card._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:42 PM)_

> Emmett: Why did we stun him for this long again?
> 8ball Do I begin trying to introduce myself to the rest of the crew?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 03:42 PM)_
Sad to tell you that it does not happen.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:42 PM)_

> Seth: He woke up a while ago.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 03:42 PM)_
8ball does anyone notice Theylin in that jar?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 03:42 PM)_
No, but in a monotonous tone.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:43 PM)_

> Seth: I kinda maybe bonked him on the head because he was acting kinda sorta hostile

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:43 PM)_

> Emmett: Well, I don't believe I've yet to meet any of you.
> Emmett: Also, what's with this jar of water?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:43 PM)_

> Seth: He might be in a coma.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 03:43 PM)_

_tips the jar over_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:44 PM)_

**Preston** _(26-May-20 03:44 PM)_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:44 PM)_

**Michael** _(26-May-20 03:44 PM)_

_jar stops rolling_

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:44 PM)_

_Rachell looks over at the jar, making an attempt to grab it, gloveless._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:45 PM)_

_Seth grabs the credit card and puts it up to the comms unit_

**Michael** _(26-May-20 03:45 PM)_

_gets picked up by the girl_

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:45 PM)_
8ball Does Rachell grab the jar gloveless?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 03:45 PM)_
Spell it with me now, Y-E-S.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 03:45 PM)_

_starts applying pressure to all sides of the jar causing it to burst_

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:45 PM)_

> Rachell: Ah, my water.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 03:46 PM)_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:46 PM)_

_Emmett hears the sound of the glass breaking and refuses to accept what is happening. He's still waiting for Seth._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 03:46 PM)_

_starts slithering away_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:46 PM)_

> Seth: huh

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:46 PM)_

> Seth: He only has 10 ducketts

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:46 PM)_

> Iris: What's happening in here?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:46 PM)_

_Emmett shivers and sighs loudly._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:46 PM)_

> Seth: Can you see if you can find another credit card?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:46 PM)_

> Emmett: Fine. Fine.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 03:46 PM)_

_water stops moving_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:47 PM)_

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 03:47 PM)_

_Wemmfort abruptly introduces himself to the crew._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:47 PM)_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:47 PM)_

_Olag makes mwah mwah sounds_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:48 PM)_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:48 PM)_

> Emmett: Pucker up, bitch.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:48 PM)_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:49 PM)_

_Emmett needs a stepstool._

_Iris sighs._

**Preston** _(26-May-20 03:49 PM)_

> Volentina: Huh. That was... unexpected.

_Volonta just stood there, wathcing_

**Michael** _(26-May-20 03:49 PM)_

_slithers away_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:49 PM)_

_Emmett is completely startled from this. He just stares at Sanya, suspended in fluid._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:50 PM)_

_Olag slides Emmett out of his slimey asshole_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:50 PM)_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:50 PM)_

> Seth: "Thats what we call a kiss where I come from"

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:50 PM)_

> Rachell: This is... mostly unexpected.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:50 PM)_

> Seth: "Thank you Seth and Emmett, my life is complete."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:50 PM)_
8ball Is Emmett covered in anything else other than gelatin/slime?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 03:50 PM)_
Happy to tell you that it does happen.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:51 PM)_

_Olag turns into space dust and is blown away_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:51 PM)_

_Garrick regroups with the others outside, and sees Emmett trapped inside the slimey man._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:51 PM)_

_Emmett covered his face, really embarrassed._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:51 PM)_

_Intercom turns on_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:51 PM)_

> Seth: "HELLO! HELLO!"

**Preston** _(26-May-20 03:51 PM)_

> Volentina: Least he's not dead. Not _entirely_ dead anyways.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:51 PM)_

> Rachell: Can I assist you with psychological damages?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:51 PM)_

> Emmett: I-I

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:51 PM)_

> Iris: Oh, hey Garrick.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:51 PM)_

> Sanya: Well Emmett, you're now a gay icon. How do you feel?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:52 PM)_

> Emmett: I hated that with every part of my soul.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:52 PM)_

> Rachell: Would you be interested in some 'therapy'?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:52 PM)_

> Garrick: Can he... breathe?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:52 PM)_

> Emmett: Therapy? You're a two equinox old child!

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:52 PM)_

> Sanya: Someone get him a towel.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:52 PM)_

> Seth: "Well! if you're listening to this that means Emmett has kissed me and I have died."

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:52 PM)_

> Rachell: And you are covered in feces.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:53 PM)_

_Emmett leaned upward._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:53 PM)_

> Emmett: Want to eat it off of me or whatever?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:53 PM)_

> Garrick: Thanks, Emmett. You have faced your fear and saved our crew from debt.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:53 PM)_

> Garrick: Truly an honor.

**Preston** _(26-May-20 03:53 PM)_

> Volentina: Hard pass.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:53 PM)_

> Sanya: Not my style.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 03:53 PM)_

_Wemmfort ignores what happened._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:53 PM)_

_Iris laughs quietly._

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:53 PM)_

> Rachell: I'm not interested into that type of feeding.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:53 PM)_

> Seth: "This asteroid is rigged to go off in 10 minutes, all other ships except the ship I just recently repaired, aka Seth and Emmett's ship, are broken, on purpose of course"

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:53 PM)_

> Emmett: Ugh.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 03:54 PM)_

**Charles** _(26-May-20 03:54 PM)_
8ball do i land on the space station

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 03:54 PM)_
I guess not.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:54 PM)_

_Emmett sets his coms to announcement._

> Emmett: Anyone mind cleaning or covering my pathway to the shower?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:54 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't want to mess anything up.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:54 PM)_

> Sanya: Does everyone have everything they need?

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:54 PM)_

> Rachell: Actually, I'm quite against it, please, do not attempt to approach me while covered with that.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:54 PM)_

> Seth: "Now, Emmett, I love you, stay safe."

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Rachell: I can however, help you with damages, physical and psychological.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

_Emmett was blocking out the recorded message._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Iris: What a weirdly domestic line.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_
8ball does seth airlock Emmett out of the ship?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_
Very doubtful.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Seth: "Seth, your Delivery is in the back room of the main area, take anything you want"

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Garrick: New guy.

_He points to Volonta._

> Garrick: You're the janitor, you get to clean up after Emmett.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Rachell: What is a domestic line?

**Preston** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Volentina: What.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Garrick: You. Clean up. After Emmett.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Rachell: Please, do explain, I need it for my research.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Seth: "This is Olag signing off"

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll round up the crew, go take a bath.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Seth: "Ta ta"

**Preston** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Volentina: Uh, ok. Do you have a mop?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_
8ball does Iris turn into pink olag

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_
Yes, but with a caveat decided by the person before you.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Garrick: Check the storage room.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

_The comms violently turn off_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Seth: Well everyone!

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Emmett: Whatever. I'm taking a shower. Hope none of you eat me or whatever.

_Emmett gets up into the ship and moves on to the bathroom._

**Preston** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Volentina: Where is the storage room?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:57 PM)_

> Sanya: Everyone just get inside, or we're leaving you behind.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:57 PM)_

> Seth: This asteroid is going to blow up, I have to grab my delivery, so you guys just head over to the ship.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:57 PM)_

> Garrick: Downstairs.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:57 PM)_

> Seth: Waiter!

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:57 PM)_

> Seth: Join me

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:57 PM)_

> Seth: Ima need some hands.

**Preston** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_Volonta went in the ship in search of the storage room_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya all of a sudden start singing "Be a man" from Mulan?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_
Signs point to yes.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_Iris turns into pink Olag and then back into herself almost instantly._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_Emmett really felt terrible now. He waited for a bit before closing the restroom hatch._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

> Seth: Delivery is not there.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

> Seth: Its in that building

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

> Sanya: LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

> Sanya: TO DEFEAT

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Hey! Isn't that song copyrighted?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_Seth points at the building infront of the ship_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, crap. You're right.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

> Emmett: Um...

_Emmett took off his comm watch and his translator collar._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_
8ball does anyone notice the random puddle slithering towards the engine room

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_
No, but in a monotonous tone.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_

_Iris wanders back into the ship._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_

_DisneyPlanet shocks Sanya_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_

_Garrick follows Iris and whispers a master prank to her._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_

_Iris snorts._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_

> Iris: You're a genius.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:00 PM)_

_Seth heads into the storage area_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:00 PM)_

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:00 PM)_
8ball Does Volonta find the mop

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:00 PM)_
Yup.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:00 PM)_

_Emmett takes off his shirt and and sweatpants. He then looked at himself in the mirror._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:01 PM)_

_D: I hate this group. They're so insane they don't fear anything anymore._

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:01 PM)_

_Volonta would soon get to work cleaning the Gelatinous feces_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:01 PM)_

_Seth walks back to the ship_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:01 PM)_

_Emmett shimmied out of his boxers and turned on the shower, entering into it._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:02 PM)_

_she opens the door just slightly._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:02 PM)_

> Iris: Hey Emmett, can I come in for a second?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:02 PM)_

> Seth: I'm back niggas!

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_

> Wemmfort: What's that word you just said? It's not in my translator's programming.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_

> Seth: I got my delivery.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_

_Emmett couldn't understand Iris. He just entered the shower and closed the curtain. The hatch wasn't locked, anyhow._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_

_she turns swiftly back into herself, getting a better idea that is less likely to upset her friend._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_
8ball does Garrick watch the shenanigans unfold from a distance

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_
It is certain.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_

_Iris opens the hatch, heading inside._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:04 PM)_

> Garrick: Dewet.

_he says, in a Palpatine voice._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:04 PM)_

> Iris: Whoops, you probably can't understand me. Uhh, how do I adjust this thing...

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:04 PM)_

_She could hear a whistling tune from inside the shower._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:04 PM)_

_Seth sits on the couch and starts going over the things he got_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:05 PM)_

_She fiddles with her translator for a second, looking for the Squoatian setting._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:05 PM)_

> Iris: Uh... can you understand me now?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:06 PM)_

> Seth: Hmmm

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:06 PM)_

> Seth: Seth decides its time to go get some food

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:06 PM)_

_Emmett notices the voice and sticks a hoof out of the curtain. He grabs his translator for her and puts it on._

> Emmett: Iris?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:06 PM)_

_Seth heads to the fridge_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:06 PM)_

> Iris: That's my name.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:06 PM)_

> Seth: Seth decides he wants a carrot cake

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_

> Emmett: It's been like 4 GUYs since you've done this.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_

_Seth takes a carrot cake from the fridge_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_

_She laughs._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_

> Iris: I forgot i did this before.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_
8ball Does another ship land next to the crew's ship?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_
My sources say no.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_

> Seth: Seth decides he's going to eat the entire thing and leave none for Emmett because he acted like a bitch

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_

_Seth eats the entire carrot cake_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_
8ball Does an Escape pod crash near the ship?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_
Signs point to no.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_

> Garrick: Hey, can anyone else get us off of this asteroid? We only have a few minutes left.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_

> Emmett: We did have a little fling when we were younger.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_

_Emmett suds his face thoroughly._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_

_Iris' cheeks turn pink._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll see if i can start the auto-pilot.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_

_Seth's mouth turns into a vacuum cleaner as he sucks up the carrot cake whole_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_

> Iris: That was so long ago.

**Silas** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_
8ball does a Molemobile emerge from the ground near the ship?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_
N Word. (No).

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_

> Seth: Seth decides he's going to pilot the ship

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:09 PM)_

> Garrick: ...Sanya, can you do it?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:09 PM)_

_Sanya sits in the cockpit, realizing she has no knowledge of how to drive_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:09 PM)_

> Sanya: Seth, how do i drive this?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:09 PM)_

_Seth heads to the cockpit_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:09 PM)_

> Iris: Anyways, i came here to make sure you're okay.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:09 PM)_

> Seth: I have it my friend, says Seth.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:09 PM)_
Woah! Emmett Flower with no brim!

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Sanya: That would be an awful idea.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Seth: Seth decides he's going to show Sanya how a real pilot pilots.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Iris: I mean, that whole thing was pretty weird. Like,

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Sanya: Just tell me what buttons to press.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

_Garrick peeks into the cockpit._

> Garrick: I could try.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Seth: Seth sits in the driver seat

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

_Seth sits down_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Sanya: Get off of my lap.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

_Iris takes this moment to shift into Olag and mimick his voice, but with a really high pitch._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Seth: Next time sit in the right chair Seth says.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Seth: Seth turns the key

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

_Seth turns the key_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

> Iris: I love you, stay safe,

_she mocks, in a very mocking tone._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

> Garrick: Shoot! I'm missing the prank!

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

_Garrick hurries off back to the bathroom._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

_Emmett scrubbed himself down and felt pretty clean. He just had to get his horns-_

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_
8ball does a ship emerge from under the asteroid and land in the station

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_
My reply is no.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

> Seth: Flip that red switch over there Seth says

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_
He says turns the key as he turns the key

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

> Seth: Seth points

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

_Seth points_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

_Emmett jumped a little._

> Emmett: I thought you were dead!

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

_she turns back into herself._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

> Sanya: Sanya is getting really tired of Seth narrating himself.

_She flips the lever_

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_
Seth is his own narrator

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Seth: Seth says you can go fuck yourself you stupid sunflower.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm literally taking a shower to get out of your... shit.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Iris: Sorry, sorry, I thought i had the voice different enough you'd know it was me.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Seth: Seth firmly grasps the wheel

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:12 PM)_

_Seth grasps the wheel_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Garrick: No, Iris, what are you doing?!

_He says this way louder than the whisper he intended._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll have fun taking you apart one day.

_Sanya gets up and sits in the co-pilot seat._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

_iris looks up to fix Garrick with a very monotone glare._

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

_Volonta walks up and taps on Garrick's shoulder_

> Volentina: Where do I clean this off at?

_He holds up the shit stained mop_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Seth: Flip the blue switch, says Seth

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Wemmfort throws a bottle of space juice to Seth.

**Silas** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_
8ball does a 2009 Toyota Prius drive up and park next to the ship?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_
Choose someone who decides for me.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

_Sanya flips the switch._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

_Emmett opens up the curtain a little bit. He was still covering his lower half, but his torso was definitely showing. His horns were doused in soap._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Sanya: Would it kill you to say please?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Emmett: What?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Emmett: Iris, was that you?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Garrick: Wait until Emmett gets out of the shower, I guess.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

_The ship starts to float up_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Iris: Yeah it was.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Seth: We are launching says Seth.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Seth: Seth turns on the intercom on the ship

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

_Seth flips a switch_

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

_Volonta shrugs his shoulders and leans the mop against a wall before wandering around_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Seth: Seth begins speaking

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

_Iris mimics Garrick's voice but not his body._

> Iris: Don't make me do it Garrick.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

_Emmett felt turbulence from the ship launching._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Garrick: Do what? What're you gonna do?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Seth: HELLO! THIS IS YOUR NEW PILOT SPEAKING! WE ARE LAUNCHING SO WE DON'T DIE. Says Seth.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

_Dakari wakes from his nap to rumbling of the ship launching and Seth's voice over the intercom_

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Wemmfort stumbles around the ship.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Emmett: I need to get out of here. Someone's flying when they're no supposed-

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

_Iris turns her face into Garrick's. Just her face, though._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

_Emmett puts on his comms._

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

_Wemmfort stumbles around the ship._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Emmett: Get the fuck out of my seat!

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Seth: Seth launches the ship forward with a jolt

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

_Seth launches the ship forward with a jolt_

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Wemmfort didn't put his seatbelt on

_Wemmfort didn't put his seatbelt on_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

_Emmett is launched from the shower to the bathroom door._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth!

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

_Garrick, horrified, scurries off._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Seth: Seth turns on autopilot but accidently turns on disco mode in the progress

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Sanya: Sanya is this close to doing bodily harm on Seth

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

_Iris laughs._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Emmett: Get the fuck out of my seat!

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

_Seth turns on autopilot but accidently turns on disco mode in the progress_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Iris: That's what i call a prank.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_
Charles goes next

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Seth: Looks like it is dancing time, Seth quips.

**Silas** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_
8ball in his genuine fear, does Garrick stumble and drop something out of his pockets?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_
You may rely on it.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Seth: Seth does the funny laugh

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_

_Rachell has been slammed against one of the walls of the ship, her goopy body melting part of said wall._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_

_Seth laughs_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_
"Fake Lottery Ticket"

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_

> Rachell: This is... interesting.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_

_Seth hops off the seat_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_

_Iris quickly covers her eyes once she notices that Emmett is out of the shower._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_

> Seth: Thats enough of that

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_
8ball Does Wemmfort attempt to put a seatbelt on?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_
Yes, but in a monotonous tone.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Seth: Emmett, we're heading to Station 30-x2.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

_Emmett clearly didn't care that he was naked. He stormed over to the cockpit._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Emmett: This is my spot, dumbshit.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I am going to put on my seatbelt.> Wemmfort: I am safe now.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

_Seth jolts the ship forward again_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Sanya: Put on a towel, you're indecent.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Seth: Don't come in the cockpit with your cock out.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Seth: Thats my job.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

_Emmett is jostled onto Sanya from the sudden jolt._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_

> Garrick: Like father, like son.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_

> Seth: Now, y'all have fun.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_

_Iris follows him, stumbling a bit on occasion._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_

> Sanya: Get off. You're getting my outfit wet.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_

> Emmett: You're going to destroy my baby! Get handling her that way!

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_
8ball does Vargas go to space station 30-x2

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_
Spell it with me now, N-O.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_

_Emmett hops off of Sanya, and as Seth specified, his cock was a little out._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_

> Seth: She'll live man.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_

_Garrick returns to his room to log the failure of his prank._

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_

_Rachel takes a peek at the cockpit her face still absorbing some of that metal that stuck to her earlier._

> Rachell: What is happening? Please report.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_
8ball does Iris throw a towel at Emmett

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_
No, but something that the person after you decides upon happens.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_

> Seth: I handled her like this way before you ever were born.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_

> Sanya: Seth's driving the same way he lives: Recklessly.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth's ruining my ship.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_

_Emmett was flaccid and clearly upset._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:21 PM)_

> Seth: Im not but ok

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:21 PM)_
8ball Do I walk up on Emmett and Iris' fiasco?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:21 PM)_
Of course not!

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:21 PM)_

> Rachell: I think one of the walls may have a hole in it now.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:21 PM)_

_Dakari walking towards the cockpit_

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:21 PM)_

> Dakari: What are you guys doing, and why is Emmett butt naked?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Emmett: Oh.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Emmett: Hello then.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Stop looking at him.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Iris: Clothes, Emmett!

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Sanya: Seth decided to drive.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

_Emmett looks down and shrugs._

> Emmett: Well, Seth did decide to drive.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Dakari: We're doomed then.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Rachell: What is that flesh wand, Emmett?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Emmett: I mean, can someone grab me my clothes from-

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Emmett: Flesh... Wand?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

_Garrick returns to the cockpit, pulls out some pants, and throws them at Emmett._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_
8ball does anyone seem to notice the sentient water slithering around their ship?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_
Yes.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Pants.

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Volentina: What the fuck is this

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: That's what we call a Dick in my culture.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Rachell: Yes, that thing, between you legs, my research must continue.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Sanya: Don't even try it, weirdo.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Rachell: I must examine it, now.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

_Iris chokes a bit on air, cheeks turning red._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

_moves around as a puddle_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Seth might let you examine him.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Iris: Guys can you please stop talking about Emmett's dick??

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Emmett: It's my cock.

_The pants were clearly too small. He, using the pants like a sockpuppet, covered his willy._

**Silas** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_
haha penis

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

_Volonta grabs the mop and readies it to clean the puddle_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Garrick: No, it's the topic of conversation right now. Get over it.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Emmett: This is not like the typical jobs I'd sign up for.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_
I'm in pain

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

_runs away from the mop_

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Rachell: The 'Seth' person is quite creepy, please, keep him away from me.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

_Seth turns up the speed on the ship_

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

_Volonta chases the puddle_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Seth: Emmett, turn on the warp drive for me

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Emmett: We have moving water-

_Emmett slid to another wall._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Sanya: Hey, she got lesson 1 of the Vortox Pummelers down.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:25 PM)_

> Seth: I don't think Olag unwrapped it yet

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:25 PM)_

_Iris holds her hand out to Rachell._

> Iris: I don't think we've officially met, my name is Iris!

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:25 PM)_

_moves between Emmett's legs_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:25 PM)_

> Emmett: The fuck is that thing?

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:25 PM)_

_runs towards the kitchen_

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:25 PM)_

> Volentina: Sentient puddle. I have no fucking clue.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:25 PM)_

> Emmett: OKAY, OKAY.

_Emmett stands up._

> Emmett: Who wants to go with me to the engine room?

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

_He chases again_

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

_Rachell looks at Iris, then her hand, it's a blank unfeeling stare._

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

> Dakari: You know what, I'll go.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

> Rachell: Hello, Iris.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

_moves under Volonta and tries to trip him_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

_Iris turns her head towards Emmett._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

> Iris: I'll go!

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

> Dakari: I've been awake for 5 minutes, and I already need a break.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Let's go, Iris and Dakari.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

_She retracts her hand before looking at Rachell._

> Iris: What's your name?

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

_volonta just lifts his foot up and shoves the mop down towards the puddle_

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

> Rachell: Rachell, that is my designation.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

_Vargas wanders around deep space for a bit._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

_Iris smiles._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

_Emmett was now awkwardly erect, the pants moving upward._

> Emmett: Can we get going?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll stay here and make sure Seth doesn't kill us all.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_
8ball Does Rachell attempt physical contact with Iris?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_
Outlook bad.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

> Iris: Nice to meet you Rachell, I've gotta go!

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

> Dakari: Let's

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Garrick: Yo. Valantia.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

_separates so the mop doesn't hit him_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Garrick: Where are you?

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Volentina: Trying to mop up an unmoppable puddle

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Iris: We'll talk later though, okay?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_
`

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_
8ball Does Garrick get stuck in his own pocket?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_
Yes, but with a caveat decided by the next person.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

_starts rising to reveal his Torrid form_

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

_Rachell gives Iris another blank stare._

> Rachell: Ok, if you suffer any psychological or physical damage, procure my assistance.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

_Walks off towards the engine room, looking around for any slimy changes._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Theylin: HELLO!

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Theylin: HOW ARE YOU?!

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Garrick: Okay, well, when you get done, I have a job for you.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Vargas: I see a person flying like a a maniac.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Garrick: It's easy.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

_Iris nods, smiling as she jogs backwards._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Theylin: CAN. YOU. HEAR. ME!?

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_
8ball Does Dakari notice any notable sliminess in the engine room?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_
Without a doubt.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Iris: Alright, i will!

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

_Vargas sees a person flying like a maniac._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Theylin: I. AM. PEACEFUL!

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Volentina: So you aren't a puddle. Figures.

_Volonta stops trying to mop up the 'puddle'_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Emmett: Oh my Squoat.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

_She turns to follow Emmett properly._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Emmett: Why did he ruin everything?

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Dakari: I think your friend left quite a gift for you Emmett...

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Theylin: CAN. YOU. UNDERSTAND. MY. SPEAK?!

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:30 PM)_

_Volonta then goes to find Garrick_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Garrick: What's the deal, Emmett?

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:30 PM)_

_follows the newcomer_

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:30 PM)_

_Rachell keeps following Emmett, well, more like stalking him._

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Vargas: That ship almost hit me!

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Sanya: Well, Seth, what's at this station we're heading to?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_
8ball does Emmett turn into a marble?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_
I guess so.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_Emmett shivered._

> Emmett: Stay in here for me. I'm getting my clothes on. I don't want anymore of Olag's stuff on me. Especially not my....

_Emmett rolled away to the restroom before finishing his statement._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Seth: Its a pirate station

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Theylin: CAN. ANYONE. SHOW. ME. TO. THIS. SHIP'S. CAPTAIN?!

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_Iris nods._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Iris: Yeah I'll wait here.

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_Volonta tapped on Garrick's shoulder_

> Volentina: You needed me?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:32 PM)_

_Volonta's hand phases through Garrick, and Volonta falls through him._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:32 PM)_

> Sanya: Pirates? I may have to wait this one out.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:32 PM)_

_wanders around the ship_

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:32 PM)_

_Vargas follows that ship to cuss out their pilot._

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:32 PM)_

> Volentina: Oh. Uh. Sorry?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:32 PM)_

> Seth: No no no

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

_Emmett turns back into himself and puts his clothes back on. In particular, he was wearing the red sweater with the yellow shoulder pads. He then left to the engine room._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Garrick: Yeah, I need you in the storage room again.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Seth: By pirate station I mean its not GU oriented.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

_wanders around the ships, seemingly stumbling into an engine room_

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Volentina: Does it require the mop? If so I'd need to clean it.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Garrick: No.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Garrick: Come.

_Garrick trails off towards the storage room._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Theylin: HELLO?! I. COME. IN. PEACE!

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

_Volonta began to follow Garrick_

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Theylin: WHERE. IS. THE. SHIP'S. CAPTAIN?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

_He nudged Iris kiddingly._

> Emmett: I mean, I'm just too hot for you guys to handle.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Emmett: Dakari.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Emmett: Can you pave a way to the warp drive?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:34 PM)_

_Iris chuckles._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, that's better. I had a hit on a big wig Pirate in my early days. People still hunt me out for it.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Dakari: Yea, no problem I suppose.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:34 PM)_

_just looks around the... lack-luster engine room_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:34 PM)_

_Garrick points towards a huge pile of overflowing boxes._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Garrick: So, that's gotta go. Do you know how to use the airlock?

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_

_mumbles_

> Theylin: not the greatest engine

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_
8ball Does the warp drive get set into place?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_
Outlook bad.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: Olag's an idiot.

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Volentina: I can't say I do. Never been on a ship, so it's safe to say no.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_

_There are two holes inside the ship shaped like Rachell's face, do not question them._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: He didn't even get this put in.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_

_Iris nods, turning into pink Olag._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Garrick: Hmm... well, we can take care of that later, I guess.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Vargas: Vargas starts to contact the dumbass drivers ship.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Iris: I'm Olag and I fixed your ship and I'm charging 100,000 Ducketts.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Dakari: Gosh... I didn't realize you could change forms Iris.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

_Emmett sees Iris and jumps up and latches on the roof. This wasn't too hard, given lack of gravity in the engine room._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

_She turns back into herself._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Iris: You okay Emmett?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Emmett: Iris, you can shapeshift?

_He was noticeably shivering._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Iris: I couldn't change forms until, like, yesterday.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Vargas: Hello hello? Can you hear me?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Iris: Remember that thing with the pink ghost?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Emmett: Oh. That.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Dakari: No, wasn't there.

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

_Volonta just shrugs and walks towards the bathroom to wash the mop_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

_Seth steadily speeds up the ship_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

_Emmett falls and starts to lift the warp drive._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Emmett: Help out.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Iris: Well I kind of absorbed a ghost and now I can shapeshift and touch ghosts.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

_Garrick is interested in their conversation, and regroups with Iris and the others._

> Garrick: So, how's that going anyways?

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

_starts examining the engine_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Garrick: Is she somehow conscious?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

_Iris turns into pink Emmett._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Garrick: Any voices in your head so far?

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Dakari: That's... useful.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya leave Seth to his devices?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_
Outlook bad.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Emmett: Is that comfortable for you?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Sanya: I still don't trust you alone.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Sanya: Especially not driving.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Iris: It's basically fine except for the part where I'm pink when I'm in any form other than mine.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_
8ball does Vargas boards the wavering ship.

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_
It is certain.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Emmett: I kinda find it... hot.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Dakari: Get a room.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Garrick: Sounds like a win-win to me.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

_Emmett, despite asking for help, lifts the warp drive and sets it into place._

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Vargas: Hello?

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

_Dakari begins helping Emmett with the warp drive_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Iris: And sometimes i have vivid dreams about being sucked into a pink void.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Dakari: My bad.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Garrick: Turn into a Squoatling and fulfill Emmett's biggest desires.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Iris: But other than that!

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

_Vargas searches for people._

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Dakari: See, you clearly had the warp drive handled.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

_Emmett was panting from the weight._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

_Iris turns back into herself, stretching._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Emmett: That's pretty realistic...

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Sanya: Seth, we got an intruder.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

_Dakari slaps Emmett on the back_

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Dakari: Good job

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_
\*Vargas stomps his way around till he finds the cockpit
(edited)

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:41 PM)_

> Iris: Except for the part where I'm pink, it's a perfect replication.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:41 PM)_

> Emmett: Could you turn back to the Squoatling for-

_Emmett fell over from the slap._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:41 PM)_

_She changes her voice to Emmett's._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:41 PM)_

> Iris: I can do voices, too.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Emmett: That sounds nothing like me.

_Emmett's voice was muffled from the ground._

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

_Vargas finds a teleporter._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

_She laughs, still in Emmett's voice._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Seth: Hey you see that ship over there?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Iris: I'm sure it doesn't.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Seth: Wanna see me ram it?

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_
Is it my turn?

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

\*\*

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

_She reaches out to offer Emmett her hand._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

_Seth blasts the ship to high hell_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Sanya: Yes, Seth. Ram the ship and ignore the current intruder.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Seth: Well, now he can't escape

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

_Vargas is sent to the cockpit._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

_Looks up at her and smiles softly. He took her hand soon after._

> Emmett: Do you have the same texture and everything?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Seth: Oh look hes here.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Vargas: WTF.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

_Iris turns back into Emmett._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

_Sanya throws her knife, nearly hitting Vargas._

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Vargas: Thats my ship

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Iris: I wouldn't know.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Seth: Ok?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Sanya: Watch your tounge.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Dakari: Hey, what's that smell?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Seth: You missed Sunflower.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:44 PM)_

_Vargas dodges and ask why youre about to ram his ship._

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Dakari: Smells like Olag and shit.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:44 PM)_

_Emmett rubbed his digits on her form's horns, expecting that she didn't keep the qualities of whatever she shapeshifted into._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Emmett: Woah.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Sanya: You intrude our ship, and try to make demands?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Emmett: This is pretty real.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Garrick: Creepy. You two have fun.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:44 PM)_

_Pink Emmett Iris shrugs._

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Vargas: You hit my ship driving like a maniac!

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_

_goes back to being a puddle_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Seth: Ok?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_

_She grins wickedly, turning into pink Garrick._

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_
8ball Does Wemmfort give the rest of his Space juice to Seth?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_
Nien.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Seth: Whats the problem?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Seth: You can get it repaired.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Garrick: Nope. Leaving.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Garrick: Not having this again.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_

_Vargas yelling._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Seth: Seth yells back

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Emmett: Anyhow, I'm going back to the cockpit before I get more curious.

_Emmett leaves the two._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Iris: Come on Garrick, don't be like that.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Dakari: Emmett, you need a shower. And to find a room with Iris, clearly.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:45 PM)_

_She's mimicking Garrick's voice._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:46 PM)_

> Garrick: I take it back, this ability is awful.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:46 PM)_

> Sanya: You people are insufferable. Just get rid of him.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:46 PM)_

_She follows him._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:46 PM)_

> Emmett: Fuck you, Dakari.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:46 PM)_

> Iris: Garrickkk~~~

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:46 PM)_

> Emmett: Quite the drama we have here.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:46 PM)_

> Dakari: Hey, man. Just saying.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:46 PM)_

> Vargas: Do you have a better pilot, cause he sucks balls.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:46 PM)_

_Emmett sees the 8ball man and water boy._

> Emmett: Wat

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:46 PM)_

> Seth: Hey Sunflower, can you airlock this guy?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:46 PM)_

> Seth: I'm gonna finish wrecking his ship.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_

> Sanya: I don't know where the button is.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_

> Vargas: Fuck you!

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_

> Seth: Red button on your right

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_

> Iris: Garrick where are you going~?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_

> Sanya: Thank you.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_

_Seth continues firing at the ship_

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_

> Vargas: Whos the ships captain!?!

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_

> Garrick: The pool.

**Silas** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_
8ball does everyone suddenly feel the need to go to the living room?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_
As I see it, yes.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_

> Seth: You like that you dirty slut.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't care.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

> Seth: I am the captain.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

_She turns back into herself._

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

_Dakari follows Emmett cautiously holding his nose_

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

_heads toward the living room despite not knowing where it is_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

> Sanya: Fuck it. You deal with the asshole.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

_stops being a puddle_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

> Iris: Oh, cool. Can I come?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

_Sanya leaves for the Living Room._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

_Garrick heads to the living room, and then the pool._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

_Emmett slapped Dakari back and laid on a couch in the living room._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

> Garrick: Sure, but not in my form, please.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

> Vargas: With your level of intelligence. not possible.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

> Seth: You seem mad kid.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

> Sanya: Seth, if he's still here, I'll kill him myself.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

> Iris: Okay, not in your form.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

> Seth: Maybe go back to the daycare.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:49 PM)_

> Emmett: Y'know, I kinda felt free while naked.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:49 PM)_

> Vargas: Whos the real captain?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:49 PM)_

_Emmett was just saying this to himself._
8ball Do I walk off to tend to my belongings?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:49 PM)_
No, but something that the person before you decides upon happens.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:49 PM)_

_casually chills in this living room_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:50 PM)_

> Emmett: Ow
> Emmett: So, there's living water puddle and.... 8ball man.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:50 PM)_

> Seth: Its me retard.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:50 PM)_

_Dakari lounges on his own couch in the living room_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:50 PM)_

> Emmett: What are you guys doing here?

_Emmett's words meant nothing to her, very likely._

_Garrick pulls out a re-sealed Soda Can and takes a sip._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:55 PM)_

_Iris catches it and drinks some._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:56 PM)_

> Theylin: aight, imma be honest. I'm a trespasser and I need passage. I'm willing to offer my services to you guys if you can get me to a space port.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:56 PM)_
8ball Does Seth finish destroying the ship and then head to the living room?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:56 PM)_
My reply is no.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:56 PM)_

_Emmett lifted his arms up to Sanya's face and pushed her cheeks._

> Emmett: Let's make love, not war.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:56 PM)_

> Theylin: I'm a master engineer

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:56 PM)_

_It's terrible. Iris coughs._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:56 PM)_

> Sanya: War is more fun. And you're not my type.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:57 PM)_

_Emmett rolled his eyes._

> Emmett: I'm in heat and you're more of a pervert than I am.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:57 PM)_

> Theylin: I'm on a pilgrimage for my home, may I formally offer my services for passage?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:58 PM)_

_Sanya is unfazed by Emmett's blabbering._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:58 PM)_

_Garrick floats up through the ceiling to spray Vargas's eyes with salt._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:59 PM)_

_Iris sighs._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:59 PM)_

_Emmett sighed and left to the pool, given that he was clearly being ignored._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:59 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya grab something out of dread?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:59 PM)_
Ja.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:59 PM)_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:00 PM)_

> Emmett: Iris, you here?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:00 PM)_

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:01 PM)_
Yes, but with a caveat decided by the next person.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:01 PM)_

_Emmett had a mocking, sarcastic tone._

> Emmett: Sanya's bullying me and the rest of the crew are being neurotic over a puddle of water.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:03 PM)_

_Emmett laid in a pool chair, near Iris._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:03 PM)_

> Emmett: Sometimes I just feel really ignored by everyone.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:04 PM)_

_Sanya follows Emmett to the pool and sits nearby._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:04 PM)_

_Iris lays back._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:05 PM)_

_Emmett was confused._

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 05:05 PM)_

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:05 PM)_

> Vargas: My dead best friend

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:05 PM)_

> Garrick: Emmett, it's because you're not assertive.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:05 PM)_

> Garrick: No offense, dude, but you're kind of a pushover sometimes.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:06 PM)_

> Emmett: I'd just feel really mean if I were to do that.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:07 PM)_

_Vargas makes lunch for everyone as a second apology ._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:07 PM)_

> Garrick: You gotta take SOME initiative, being the pilot and all. You're way more sensible than Seth.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:07 PM)_

> Garrick: Look at me, I bossed around the new guy earlier even though I have absolutely no power over him.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:07 PM)_

> Vargas: Come get lunch. I made more than enough for everyone.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:07 PM)_

_Iris shrugs._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:08 PM)_

> Sanya: Listen Emmett. It's not mean to stand up for yourself. Garrick's right, you are a bit of a pushover. I've been trying to toughen you up a bit.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:08 PM)_

_Emmett was trying to discretely flex to get more blood pumping in his arms._

> Emmett: I mean, I guess.

_Iris stands._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:11 PM)_

_Emmett checked his grass watch, selectively hearing Sanya's conclusion._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, that's your problem!

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:23 PM)_

_Iris starts to bake croissants._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:24 PM)_

_Sanya grabs Emmett's arm._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:24 PM)_

> Sanya: Do not do this.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 05:24 PM)_
8ball Does Dakari go and explore the rest of the ship?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:24 PM)_
It is certain.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:24 PM)_

_Emmett backs up from the pool to the edge of the ship. Afterwards, he was grabbed._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:24 PM)_

_Iris is baking croissants._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:24 PM)_

> Emmett: I just really want to be listened to.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:25 PM)_
It says indicisive.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:25 PM)_

_Garrick pockets the spear._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 05:25 PM)_
8ball does Vargas pass out?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:25 PM)_
Person who's after you decides!

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_
Yes

> Emmett: I'm unstable, aren't I?

**Michael** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

_knocks on the Vortox's Pummelers ship door_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Not as unstable as he is.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Theylin: Hello?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Fucking clown.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Garrick: Yeah, man. This isn't what I meant when I said to 'take initiative'.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

_Vargas wakes up._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

_Emmett leans back off the railing._

**Silas** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_
8ball does Vargas feel himself slowly transforming into a marble?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_
N0.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Garrick: You feeling alright?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: No.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

_Croissants._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: I feel empty.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Filled with angry spirits.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:27 PM)_
_Vargas gets kidnapped. _

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:27 PM)_

> Emmett: Filled with lust and envy and wrath.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 05:27 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett pee in the pool?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:27 PM)_
Sad to tell you that it does not happen.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 05:27 PM)_

> Theylin: Hello?!

_continues knocking on the door of Seth's ship_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:27 PM)_
8ball Do I zip up Vargas' hands?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:27 PM)_
Very doubtful.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Emmett: I need grass.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Emmett: I need grass bad.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Garrick: Sanya, you got any?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Emmett: How often do you chase that high?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Sanya: I might.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:28 PM)_

_Iris is just still baking croissants._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett: What high?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett: This feels terrible!

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:29 PM)_

> Garrick: Is this grass stuff healthy for you?

**Michael** _(26-May-20 05:29 PM)_

_bangs on Seth's ship door_

> Theylin: I know y'all are in there

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:29 PM)_

> Garrick: It's having very adverse effects.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett: That's called a withdrawal where I'm from.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_

_Sanya pulls out Garrick's true identity, then puts it back._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_

_Emmett slid down and held his legs to himself._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_
8ball has Iris baked 1000 croissants?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_
You got it.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't know...?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_

_Garrick is imbued with immense fear while the index card is exposed._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_

_He decides to look again..._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_

> Emmett: I've had grass for like, my entire life!

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_

_Sanya glares deep at Garrick, then sits with Emmett._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:31 PM)_

> Emmett: I feel like everyone is staring at me.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:31 PM)_

> Sanya: Because we care.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:31 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm always being stared at.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:31 PM)_

_Iris has baked 1000 croissants and feels a little bit better. She keeps making croissants, though._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:31 PM)_

> Emmett: But the whole galaxy's eyes are on me.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:31 PM)_

> Sanya: Hey, you did end up taking my advice. You wanted people to care, so you made us care.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_
8ball Does Squoat chime in?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_
Yo mama. (Yes).

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, in all fairness, you are the most wanted man right now.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_

> Sanya: The life you live will be and always has been a dangerous one.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_

_To Emmett, this was a loud ass voice. To everyone else, some buzzing was coming from his ears._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_

> Emmett: "SQUEMFET."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_

> Emmett: What?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_

> Emmett: Who's there?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:33 PM)_

_D: He is here. Leave the Squoat be._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:33 PM)_

> Emmett: "IT'S ME. SQUOAT."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:33 PM)_

> Emmett: What? How are you speaking to me?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:34 PM)_
Signs point to yes.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:35 PM)_

> Emmett: "I can speak to every Squoatling."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:35 PM)_

> Emmett: "I'm god-I mean, I'm Squoat, remember?"

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:35 PM)_

> Garrick: What's wrong, Dread?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: It's been a while since I've seen you.
> Emmett: Is he alright?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

_Iris is baking croissants._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: "Nevermind that. I need to tell you something."

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

_His god is talking to him._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: What?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Garrick: Oh. Good timing.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

_We should let them commune in peace._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: "I've been on the run."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: On the run? What does that even mean? You're Squoat!

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: "Squoat's gotten himself into some trouble."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

_Emmett was having a revelation in his mind about now._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: "I've gotten to a safespace to talk with you."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: It took you...

_Emmett counts on his digits._

> Emmett: "Thirteen GUYs. I know."

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:38 PM)_

_When a god communes with an individual, it's normally a big deal. Maybe not for others, but if, say, Sanya met with a group of Florans, she would be treated as a messiah._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:39 PM)_

> Emmett: "Just let me continue. I need you to get off the grass."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:39 PM)_

> Emmett: Why?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:39 PM)_

> Garrick: Interesting.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:39 PM)_

> Garrick: He certainly looks entranced.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "It's terrible for you! Your family got you high on that stuff."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "The only reason the Tawfeeks were rich was because of their mass production of grass."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "Your parents left you alone a lot to make deals, my son."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "You were played."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "I know you need grass to live, Emmett. You have fetal grass syndrome or whatever."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "But you really need to cut down on it. A lot."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "You're going to kill yourself."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: Uhm.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: Okay.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: But I don't know how to stop.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "Find a way. I'll tell you a way to find her if you do so."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: Who?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:46 PM)_
8ball has Iris made a huge model ship out of croissants in the kitchen

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:46 PM)_
It is decidedly so.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:46 PM)_

> Emmett: "Oh, you know. Yo Mama."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:46 PM)_

> Emmett: Who's that?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:46 PM)_

> Emmett: "It was a joke."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:46 PM)_

> Emmett: "I'll help you find Squ-"

_Squoat cut off._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:46 PM)_

> Emmett: What? What? What the fuck?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:49 PM)_

_Hm. It seems like he's gone._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:49 PM)_

_Iris critically examines the model ship of croissants._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:49 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett? Are you alright?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:49 PM)_

> Garrick: What'd he say? Emmett looks pissed off...

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:49 PM)_

> Garrick: Again.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:49 PM)_
8ball Does Iris run out into the pool suddenly in clothing made of croissants and dive?
(edited)

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:49 PM)_
Yes, definitely.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:50 PM)_

_Emmett stood up._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:50 PM)_

> Emmett: Squoat called.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:50 PM)_

> Garrick: Welcome to the party... really good timing, actually.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:50 PM)_

_Communications between gods and mortals should be contained between them. In fact, it's strange that you can even hear me, ghost._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:50 PM)_

> Garrick: Fair enough.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Emmett: I have a weird feeling about what just happened.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Iris: I baked over 2000 croissants.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Emmett: Like, Squoat didn't seem.... Sacred?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Garrick: It seems I have a lot of abilities I'm not aware of.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Iris: I feel better now.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Emmett: Does that make sense?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Iris: Yeah it does.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Sanya: Iris. Where are your normal clothes and why are you wearing croissants?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

_Iris sighs._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

> Garrick: I've heard it's like that with people you admire, Emmett.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

> Iris: I baked too many croissants.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

> Garrick: It's disappointing 9 times out of 10.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

> Sanya: Here. Let me see if i can help.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

> Iris: The batter stuck to me and baked.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

_Emmett sneaked a peek at Iris for a second._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

> Emmett: But, guys.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:53 PM)_

> Iris: My old clothes are underneath.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:53 PM)_

> Emmett: GARRICK! SANYA!

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:53 PM)_

> Emmett: LISTEN TO ME.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:53 PM)_

> Emmett: I need to get off of grass.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:53 PM)_

_Sanya turns back to Emmett, putting the weaponized Llama head back in Dread._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:54 PM)_

> Iris: does anybody have a bread knife?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:54 PM)_

> Garrick: You get a revelation about that?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:54 PM)_

> Iris: Or clothes? Either?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:55 PM)_

> Emmett: And I think Squoat isn't a god or anything.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:55 PM)_

> Emmett: He's a man on the run.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:55 PM)_

> Emmett: Which, kinda hurts my horned brain.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:55 PM)_

> Emmett: But I believe in him.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:55 PM)_

_Garrick tosses Iris the Old Kimono._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:55 PM)_

> Garrick: Wear clothes.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:56 PM)_

> Emmett: He made us from whatever we were.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:56 PM)_

_Iris catches it._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:56 PM)_

> Emmett: But yeah.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:56 PM)_

> Emmett: Help me off this shit.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:56 PM)_

> Sanya: That's... eerily familiar.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:56 PM)_

> Iris: Thanks. Uh okay where's a place to change?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:56 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, Emmett, you seem determined.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:56 PM)_

> Emmett: Tell me if I'm being aggressive or not.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:56 PM)_

> Sanya: Sure, we'll help you.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:56 PM)_

> Garrick: Whatever Squoat is, he's giving good advice.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:57 PM)_

> Emmett: My parents are lying cheats.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:57 PM)_
8ball does Iris find a place to change

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:57 PM)_
Da.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:57 PM)_

> Emmett: Let's just go back to the kitchen.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:58 PM)_

_Iris heads into the changing station and switches into the Old Kimono before she comes out._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:58 PM)_

_Iris goes to the bottom of the pool and changes._

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 05:58 PM)_
8ball Does Dakari blow up the new jacuzzi he found?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:58 PM)_
Outlook bad.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:58 PM)_

> Emmett: I heard one of you guys wanted to watch me fuck a McRib or whatever.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:58 PM)_

> Sanya: Intriguing, but no.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:58 PM)_

> Iris: I built a model ship out of croissants in there.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:58 PM)_

> Garrick: Maybe.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:58 PM)_

> Garrick: Morbid curiosity, I guess?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:59 PM)_

_Emmett shrugged and went off into the kitchen to grab a chicken sandwich._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:59 PM)_

> Iris: It... takes up almost the whole room.
