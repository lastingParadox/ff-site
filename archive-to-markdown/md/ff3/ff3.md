Very strange how they only scratched him. Hmm....

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:15 PM)_
8ball Before he left with the others, did the Llamanians grab a patch of his fur?

**FFBot** _(21-Apr-20 12:16 PM)_
Most likely.

**Rashidi** _(21-Apr-20 12:16 PM)_
Dakari is an amazing mercenary

**Rashidi** _(21-Apr-20 12:16 PM)_
No wonder you hired him

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:18 PM)_
@Brody#ff-media

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:18 PM)_
Unless you had other plans

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:18 PM)_
So currently there are five rooms to accommodate for the nine crew members that once were on the ship

**Brody** _(21-Apr-20 12:20 PM)_
I did have plans for Mary, she was really only going to be in short stories

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)_
Seth, with his own; Sanya, Emmett, Chomsky, Jim, Maia, Garrick, Iris, Hector, and Chase

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)_
Wait

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)_
That's ten

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)_
So after Maia and Chomsky left, that remained 8

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)_
I'm sure everyone would want to shift their rooms around due to the crew additions/leavings
(edited)

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)_
The chunk of ship from the Llamanians will be able to accommodate for 4 more rooms
(edited)

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)_
Plus storage and potentially another engine.

**Brody** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
Yeah

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
But for the time being, who's sharing with who? (Before the new additions)

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
We'd have two free slots

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
Chase, Iris, and Jim left eventually

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
So that's 5

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
hector went back to Mars

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
So no one is sharing rooms currently

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
Four people

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)_
Seth, Sanya, Emmett, Garrick

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 12:30 PM)_
Let's move

**Zander** _(21-Apr-20 06:48 PM)_
@deleted-roleAfter Emmett was welcomed back into the crew, he was devastated. He had spent an entire GUY under the effects of believing that he had a Squoatling wife. He had completely forgotten and forgiven Seth for airlocking him; he wanted vengeance for the Llamanians giving him a dream and them crushing it. For roughly two GUYs, he researched and steadily made a plan to ransack the Llamanian mothership, wanting to make a message that he was not someone to mess with. He didn't want to kill them off either, as he believed that they were still people under the effects of an abusive rule as opposed to monsters. He and the crew hired hundreds of mercenaries to get them into the ship and raid, with many of them being hired to be cannon fodder.
Anyhow, the day before the current episode was the day of the raid. While Emmett planned on killing a few Llamanians and stealing some of their machinery, the crew somehow stole a chunk of the mothership that was almost the size of their own ship. The original crew left with little damage, aside from Seth breaking his leg. All that was left from the assault was a chunk of Emmett's fur, taken from the back of his neck.

The current episode was the aftermath of their celebration, when Emmett got pretty drunk and Seth took on an army of ladies. Currently, everyone is asleep, Chomsky, Iris, and Dakari are sleeping in the living block (main area/hangout room), and the holovision is on, but showing static.

The Anole and the Alternion are currently at a space station. The crew is pretty low on fuel and food, but should be able to make it to the spacestation, given they want to fly there. The weekly GU broadcast, which showcases important news and announcements, is meant to broadcast soon.

_Emmett grabs the fuel hose from the ship._

Very doubtful.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 04:25 PM)_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 04:26 PM)_

_Iris is glaring at Garrick- she won't let this go until her dagger is back where it belongs._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 04:26 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 04:26 PM)_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 04:26 PM)_
No.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 04:26 PM)_

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 04:26 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 04:26 PM)_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 04:26 PM)_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 04:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Probably...
> Emmett: Actually.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 04:26 PM)_

> Iris: Can we leave him here?

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 04:27 PM)_

> Dakari: But, if we get more people, there's less room on the couch.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 04:27 PM)_

_Emmett clasps his hands over his horns, clearly having a mental meltdown._

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 04:27 PM)_

> Dakari: I say we leave him.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 04:27 PM)_

> Emmett: Is it illegal to do illegal things?

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 04:27 PM)_

> Sanya: I couldn't care either way.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 04:27 PM)_

> Seth: We have enough- wait never mind, we don't have enough money for another couch

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 04:27 PM)_

_Iris is completely unsure what to say to help Emmett._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 04:27 PM)_

> Garrick: Illegal shmillegal.

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 04:27 PM)_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 04:27 PM)_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 04:28 PM)_

> Seth: WE DON'T HAVE MONEY

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 04:28 PM)_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 04:28 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 04:28 PM)_

> Garrick: Aye aye.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 04:28 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett, aren't you yourself illegal? So why does it matter?

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 04:28 PM)_

> Dakari: Did you spend it all last night on the party?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 04:28 PM)_

> Seth: Yes, also on those mercenaries.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 04:28 PM)_

_Garrick stealthily fuels up the ship._

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 04:29 PM)_

> Sanya: Ok, so it looks like we won't really be able to pay you.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 04:29 PM)_

_Iris is itching to bake- preferably croissants._

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 04:29 PM)_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 04:29 PM)_

_Emmett drops off the hose and walks away from the ship._

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 04:30 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 04:31 PM)_

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 04:31 PM)_

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_
8ball did wes leave his oven on so his ship catches on fire

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_
Without a doubt.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Sanya: some PLANT!

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Chomsky: that sucks

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

_the croissant runs towards the storage room_

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Chomsky: guys uh, that ship...

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, can you please not send your pheromones over to our friend here?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't think he wants to fornicate.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Seth: Oh, Sanya!

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

_BOOOOOM_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Seth: Thats your name

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Chomsky: hey newbie, that yours?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Seth: I remember you.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

_Noticing the explosion, Wes is devastated._

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

> Wes: FUCK!

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

> Seth: Haha, ship go boomie

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

_Sanya takes this time to flip over the lizard and pin him to the ground_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

_Emmett holds his hoof out._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

> Garrick: Nowhere to run, TV guy.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

_Wes kicks Sanya in the chest while sprinting towards his beloved ship_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

> Emmett: Want to be even mor-

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

_Iris follows the croissant._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

_Emmett chases Wes intently_

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, you bitch.

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)_

> Chomsky: i know im the fire guy, but i swear i didnt light anything on fire this time.

_chomsky follows wes as well_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)_

_Seth draws his laser rifle and sets it to stun as he follows the two_

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)_

> Chomsky: I KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH FIRES DONT WORRY

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)_

> Garrick: Don't stop it!

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)_

_the croissant enters through a slightly open door, making a startled squeak moments later_

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)_

_Sanya races after Wes_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

_Iris dives in- she's a little attached to the croissant._

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

_Arriving at the ship in shambles, Wes falls to his knees._

> Wes: Oh, come on, that was my favorite raceship!

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

_it's pitch black inside_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_
8ball did the croissant fall off to reveal a duck?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_
Yes, definitely.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

_Emmett starts panting._

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

> Iris: Duck!

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm not in shape.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

_with the only light being a singular green dot in the back corner and the small patch from the door_

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

> Chomsky: geez, what a burn. what happened to make it go up that suddenly?

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

_Sanya catches up and draws her word_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

> Emmett: I thought those were rats. Color me surprised.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

> Sanya: Word

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

> Garrick: THATS RACIST

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

_the duck runs away hiding in the dark_

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

_Sanya then draws her sword_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

> Emmett: I was offering you a chance at redemption, Wes.
> 8ball Do I go towards the duck to pick it up?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_
The person who goes after you decides.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

> Emmett: I know your scandals.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

_Iris hurries into the dark after the duckling._

> Iris: Come back! Blueberry!

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

> Wes: It was custom made to move as fast as possible. The engine was almost completely exposed.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

> Emmett: Your steroids.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Wes: My what now? I race ships, not people.

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Chomsky: dont you know how to build a ship?! the ENGINE was exposed?!

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Emmett: What's up with your jacked up arms?

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Wes: It was supposed to allow the vaccuum of space to cool it down!

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_
Yes

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Wes: The hell are you on about?

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Sanya: Skip the formalities and just kill him.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Emmett: Look at your fucking arms!

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Wes: Let a lizard grieve, man. This thing was like a son to me.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

_The door closes and locks behind the two_

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Burner: Drop him

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Chomsky: arent you rich? cant you buy a new identical ship?

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

_Iris yelps, not liking that she can't see anything anymore._

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_
8ball Does Dakari search in his newly bought couch and find ducketts?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_
No.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Wes: What do you mean!? My arms??

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Emmett: Woah woah woah.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_
8ball does Seth aim and stun Sanya, Emmett, and Wes?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_
As I see it, yes.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Iris: Blueberry??

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

_The fear gas is kicking in._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Emmett: Lets take it easy here. Who's talking?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Seth: Ah peace and quiet

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett, just shut up. Either recruit him or kill him.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

_Emmett has a small seizure_

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Sanya: I Sw-

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Seth: Alright Garrick, help me get them into the ship

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Garrick: Let's hold him for ransom. He's famous, isn't he?

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Garrick: Gotcha.

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Chomsky: hey i'd like a famous person in our crew. maybe he can do something about emmetts bounty.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Wes: My...arms...?

_Wes watches as his arms begin melting in front of him. He is then knocked back into reality as he is stunned._

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Burner: Diver you absolute shithead

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Burner: what were you thinking

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_

_Seth starts dragging Wes, Emmett, and Sanya into the ship_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_

> Iris: I'm Iris, give me the duck.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_

> Seth: Emmett, stop squirming.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_

> Burner: Who are you.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_

> Emmett: Clearly this is more intricate than you simply wanting the Duck.
> 8ball Does Emmett, once he's unstunned, buck the shit out of Seth, literally making a poop stain on the floor?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_
Group vote. Vote in the order from first player down to last. Majority opinion wins. No changing answers.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm Mateo, and you?

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_
8ball does Garrick successfully possess Wes

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_
Most likely.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_

> Iris: Iris.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

_Seth turns on his comms_

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Good news, guys! He's weak, so I can get him on the ship!

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Emmett: I was asking the voice of which I cannot see its owner.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Wes: Why am I moving

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

_Garrick-Wes walks shakily over to the ship._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Emmett: Shhh.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Sorry, I haven't had legs in a while.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Wes: What

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Seth: I need help, we got people we need to get on the ship, aka Emmett and Sanya.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Burner: You're both going to stay quiet.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Emmett: We're getting put up for ransom.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Wes: Why is there a voice inside my head

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Emmett: And why should I listen to your demands?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Seth: Garrick, put him in the hold.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

_D: Hey Ghost, can you tell the Elf to stop dragging us so harshly?_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Iris: Why?

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Garrick: I'm your conscience. You should go with them.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Wes: ...

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Burner: Diver come here, we need to leave.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Wes: I guess I was the instigator..

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Emmett: You still haven't made clear who you are.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Garrick: Hey Seth... the flower says stop dragging them so harshly.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Emmett: Other than the fact that one of you is a duck.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Seth: I'll try.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

_Garrick-Wes makes it to the ship._

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Burner: And it's best that it stays that way

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Emmett: Yeah, sure.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Iris: I'm not a duck.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

_Emmett's tongue hangs out of his mouth and his mouth begins to foam a little._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Garrick: Seth! Grab him!

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

_D: Tell him thank you._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Emmett: We both know how this ends if you try and sneak off.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Wes: Well, I guess I could use a ride, now that my ship is fucked.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't know this crew, but most seem rather batshit.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Garrick: Also, flower says thanks.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

_Seth starts kicking Emmett_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Seth: Stop squirming.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Emmett: I think it's best you stick with me.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Burner: Is that so?

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Iris: Wow- that's a little rude?

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Chomsky: aight, you guys look like you have the...possessing handled. I'm headin back to my room

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm sorry, Cooking Mama.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Garrick: I can't hold on for very long, can someone grab this guy??

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Wes: You guys have any beetles? I'm starving.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

_Seth arrives at the ship and tosses the two into the ship_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Allow me to extend my more serious apologies.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Burner: I disagree. It's best the two of us leave and you two stay here for a minute.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Wes: Wait, why is my conscience speaking about me in the third person?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Seth: Alright, chums, lets get out of here.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Well I am going to bring up a counterclaim.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Garrick: Don't worry about it...

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: You'd rather a former GSS on your side than against you.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Garrick: Oooooo....

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Trust me.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

_Low growling is heard from the corner with the small green light_

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

_Garrick splits from Wes and knocks him out._

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Iris: I only bake when I'm stressed.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

_D: Tell the lizard that i admire his fighting spirit._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth, you had the voltage way to high!

_Emmett's voice was almost incomprehensible._

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Wes: Could you guys take me to my personal mechanic? I need to get a new S-

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Iris: Ookay, creepy noise- getting a little stressed now.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Seth: What?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Emmett: Your will is weak.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Wes: I'm...ti..red..

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_
not gay

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Iris: Yeah it is, what of it?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

_Seth starts up the auto-pilot_

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

_Wes collapses on one of the couches, taking up the whole thing._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Emmett: That's the main difference between you and I.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Seth: Alright, we're leaving.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

_a quack responds from by the door_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_

> Seth: Hope you guys had everything.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_

> Iris: Blueberry!

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_

_Iris heads towards the quack._

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_

_D: Well, this is interesting. I do want to try something, though..._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't believe for a shred that's its name.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_
8ball is Emmett unstunned?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_
My sources say no.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_

> Garrick: Hey flower.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Iris: Well what do you want me to do, ask the duck?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett: Yes.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_
8ball Does Dread possess Sanya's stunned body?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_
No.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett: It talks.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

_the growling continues_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Seth: HEY, we're launching.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Garrick: If I ate you, would I inherit dread fear power?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Seth: Steel yourselves.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Iris: Well how was I supposed to know that exactly?

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Burner: It's Diver his name is diver

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

_D: No._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Garrick: What if I stuck you in my pocket?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett: You've yet to tell me yours.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

> Iris: Okay.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

> Emmett: I feel like we're on a First-Name basis by now.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

_D: You'd have to put Sanya in your pocket, too._

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

_Iris walks over, hoping to pick up Diver._

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

> Burner: Mine doesn't matter, however diver seems to stay. what did you do?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

> Emmett: Would you leave the duck the fuck alone?

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

_D: What if i ate you? What would that do?_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

> Emmett: I beg your pardon?

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

> Iris: Would you fuck off?

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)_

> Garrick: How would you manage that?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)_

_Emmett finally stopped squirming._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)_

> Garrick: But hey, I can put Sanya in my pocket.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)_

> Iris: I dunno, he just came out of a croissant I baked and he seemed to like me.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)_

_The flower opens its eye-mouth_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)_

> Seth: Oh good we can launch.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

_D: Like this._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Emmett: Can you not stun me?

_Emmett's voice was getting more understandable._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Garrick: Does that imply that you, in your physical form, can interact with spectres?

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Garrick: That's wack.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Seth: You were a bit too hostile

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Burner: Of course it was bread involved. that's low.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Seth: I just solved that.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

_D: I was a god._

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Seth: Plus you forgot my smokes

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Garrick: Keyword: was. You're a flower now.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_
8ball does Iris pick up Diver?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_
Flip a coin with 8coin. Heads is yes, tails is no.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Garrick: Bound to a Floran.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_
8coin

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_
Heads.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_

_D: and you don't have legs, what about it?_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_

_Iris is holding Diver now._

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_

_Diver quacks unhappily_

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_

> Garrick: Movement is easier without legs.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_

> Emmett: I do not associate with her.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_

> Burner: Drop him. I'm not asking nicely

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)_

_Noting his displeasure, Iris puts him down._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)_
8ball do I find a secret light switch and flood the room with light?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)_
Yes, definitely.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)_

> Iris: I'm not an asshole, I won't hold him if he doesn't want me to.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)_

> Emmett: Aha!

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)_

8ball Does Emmett get into the living room, noticing the couch?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:38 PM)_

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

_The second duck begins cursing and thrashing in the middle of the hall_

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

_D: Oh, you bitch. When she wakes up, she will be so pissed._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

_Emmett holds out his hand in an attempt to trip whomever is causing all of the ruckus (The second duck)_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

> Iris: Are you... okay?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:40 PM)_
(Given that it's a duck, the duck would be scooped up instead of tripped.)

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:40 PM)_

_D: Wait a minute... i have an idea..._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:40 PM)_

_Garrick reaches his hand in his pocket, trying to grab Sanya._

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:41 PM)_

8ball Does Emmett run into Sanya's room and hop atop of her?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_
No. In fact, the opposite happens.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

_D: why does anyone like you, ghost?_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

_Iris makes a sad noise._

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:27 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, any of the smoothies look good to you?

_Emmett was trying to change the tone of their conversation._

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:28 PM)_

_Wemmfort is asleep, because of the conversation._

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Sanya: No. Smoothies don't interest me. I wonder if they sell raw meat...

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Dakari: Hey who's paying?

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Seth: Now give me a double McSpanky with fries and a Flurp

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Dakari: For ourselves?

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_

_Sanya starts to survey the menu._

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Emmett: Why would a diner sell raw meat?

**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Garrick: Cooked meat, maybe...

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_

_Wemmfort is taking up 2 seats, cause he's asleep._

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_
8ball Is Emmett feeling more vegetarian today?

**FFBot** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_
It is certain :8ball:

**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:30 PM)_

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:30 PM)_

_Wemmfort feels a burning sensation and quickly wakes up._

> Wemmfort: WATER! WATER!

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:30 PM)_

_Volonta rolls over on his skates towards the group_

> Volentina: Have you all decided your orders for today?

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Seth: "A double McSpanky with fries and a Flurp, that'll be $6.53. And $3.47 is your change" I hear Jimmy Neutron say. I never saw that little fuck press the buttons with food on them, so I had to go speak to him. "Dude, you're supposed to press the buttons with the pictures of food on ‘em". I say. "Don't need to Skeet, I memorized the prices and did the tax and change in my head" he replies. Ever since he fucking started at this job, he insists on trying to make things harder on them. Just last week, he had the fucking nerve to call salt "Sodium Chloride". No, you fuckwad, just call it salt. No one gives a shit how you know the basic chemical name of fucking salt. Not to mention that it's not even 100% sodium chloride, it's 98% sodium chloride with 2% trace elements. But he just insists on calling it sodium chloride. This was my moment to ruin this fucking nerd. "Dude, you do know that the pictures there aren't just for prices, right? They are logged and from there, the managers can get a rough estimate on how much food has been used and they can subtract the amount used by their stock so they know how much to order so we don't run out of food for later days. It's not just about prices. And what if you do make a mistake? Even a few cents missing from your drawer will result in potentially a write up, and doing it on numerous shifts can result in you getting fired, especially if you're missing a good amount of money

**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Garrick: Would that be cannibalism?

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:30 PM)_

_wemmfort comes back_

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_Sanya, confused and slightly offended, glares at the goat_

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Seth: Anyways with that out of the way

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Dakari: What...?

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Volentina: what

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_Emmett sunk a little._

> Emmett: I'll tell you the best looking burgers....

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Do you guys have any glass shards here?

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_
that's like water but in moldarr

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:32 PM)_

> Volentina: If you really want some, I can get you them.

**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:32 PM)_

> Garrick: Next to you.

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:32 PM)_

> Dakari: Waiter. Do you have any bark?

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:32 PM)_

> Sanya: They're all just leaves. Buy the cheapest, and get a good dressing. You won't even tell the difference.

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Volentina: Tree bark?

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Dakari: Yes

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:33 PM)_

**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:33 PM)_

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Wemmfort: For the food, do you have any dried lava here?

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Volentina: I'd.... have to get back with you on that. Yes?

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Emmett: What's your finest vegetarian thing? I'm looking to stay slim.

_Emmett is pretty fit-looking, despite his shortness._

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Volentina: I'm sure there's some kind of salad here.

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I usually smash the ship's windows for some glass. Glass is hydrating, you know.

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:35 PM)_

_Emmett awkwardly looked at Sanya._

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't think he's going to be much of a help.

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Dakari: I'll just take a salad as well waiter.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Seth: I'll take two fries, a double mcspelunkers with extra cheese, make that medium rare, a salad with extra fortnite, 2 Medium chocolate milkshakes with a shot of Dwarven rum, sprinkle some Caribeener-19 salt on top, make it turn, spit in it, make it dry, run and stomp on Emmett's foot. I'll also take 2 irish women to-go, a 3 foot 9 midget, you know, like the ones from the circus, cover her in hotsauce, shove 2 peppers up her ass, a stick, a dildo, and 4 dabs of soy sauce. OH! Can I also get uHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.... Fortnite burger, extra farts, 3 packets of Spacemayo, no cum or piss and a large coke.

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I'll share some charred lava with you, goat man.

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Sanya: Waiter. He'll take a garden salad, I'll take... what's the closest you have to goat?

_Sanya glares at Emmett with a sly smile._

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Emmett: Emmett sticks his tongue out at her.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Seth: She'll have a salad.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:36 PM)_

_Wink wink_

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:37 PM)_

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Volentina: So. Three salads, some glass shards, charred lava, and whatever he said?

_He looked between the group, looking to the crazed one last as he finished his words._

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Sanya: I will end you. NO, GET ME A STEAK.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Seth: I'll repeat it just in case

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I'm so thirsty right now, you don't even know it.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

_Seth breathes in_

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

Volonta would just blankly stare at them.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

_Sanya takes the time to look at the waiter, realizing just what she was talking to._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:45 PM)_

> Iris: I'll go buy some then.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:45 PM)_

_Garrick returns to the ship with a hunk of visibly rotten meat._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:45 PM)_

> Garrick: No need.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:45 PM)_

> Emmett: Where youu gunna get the meat?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:45 PM)_

> Sanya: What is that?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:45 PM)_

> Garrick: ...meat.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:46 PM)_

_Iris gives Garrick the most disgusted glare he's ever seen her wear._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:46 PM)_

> Garrick: Mystery meat.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:46 PM)_

> Emmett: We're stuck on a blimey assteroid with no hot chicks to bang!

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:46 PM)_

> Sanya: What's wrong with it?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:46 PM)_

> Iris: I don't joke about food.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:46 PM)_

> Garrick: Nothing's wrong with it. I just found it.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:46 PM)_

_Emmett started to cry a little._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:46 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm gonna be alone fureverr..

**Bill** _(22-May-20 03:47 PM)_
8ball are almost all of the pastry and pasta related ingredients gone from the kitchen?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 03:47 PM)_
Yes, definitely :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:47 PM)_

_Sanya gives Emmett a light kick._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:47 PM)_

> Sanya: Get up.

**Sean** _(22-May-20 03:47 PM)_

_seth poops in his fingernail and does a backflip on a baby's head before falling asleep_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:47 PM)_
Thanks Seth

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:47 PM)_

> Iris: I'll get actual, not rotten meat, while I'm out at the store.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:47 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Man, I really need a glass of glass.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:47 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I'm thirsty.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:47 PM)_

_Emmett latched onto Sanya's foot._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:47 PM)_

> Emmett: Yourre not goin anywhere.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:48 PM)_

> Garrick: So picky.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:48 PM)_

> Emmett: You're staying wif me.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:48 PM)_

> Iris: And then when I get back I'll make, like, tacos or something.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:48 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, I'll go with you.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:48 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Wemmfort finds a glass bottle, breaks it, and eats the shards from the ground.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:48 PM)_

> Garrick: Too many crackheads here right now.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:49 PM)_

> Wemmfort: That was really refreshing.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:49 PM)_

> Emmett: I didn't take crack, Garrick.

_Emmett says this with a surprisingly elegant tone._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:49 PM)_

> Garrick: Grassheads, then.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:49 PM)_

> Garrick: Meaning you and Sanya.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:50 PM)_

> Iris: Alright. Anybody else coming?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:50 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Hey! Does anybody want some glass?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:50 PM)_

> Sanya: Get off.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:50 PM)_

_She lifts her leg so that she can talk to the goat better_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_

> Emmett: You better watch out for the woman that'll follow you, ghosty mann.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_

> Iris: Alright yeah, let's go Garrick.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_

_Emmett was talking nonsense, it seemed._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya shake Emmett off of her?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_
Most likely :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_

> Sanya: Get.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_

> Garrick: Oh, come on. Iris isn't that bad.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:51 PM)_

_Sanya picks Emmett up by the back of his shirt_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:52 PM)_

_Emmett falls on his back, his mouth in a smirk._

> Emmett: I'm all ayourss, wona-

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:52 PM)_

_Wemmfort throws some glass next to garrick._

> Wemmfort: You'd seem like you'd like this.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:52 PM)_

> Emmett: PUT ME DOWN.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:52 PM)_

> Sanya: Nope.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:52 PM)_

> Emmett: NOW.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:52 PM)_

> Sanya: Im not putting you down until you're more sober.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:52 PM)_

> Iris: Alright, looks like nobody else is coming.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:53 PM)_

> Emmett: Squommy pleasse...

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:53 PM)_

> Iris: Let's get going.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:53 PM)_

> Emmett: I've been a good boy...

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:53 PM)_

_Sanya is unfazed._

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:53 PM)_
8ball should Wemmfort scrape Emmett off Sanya's leg?
(edited)

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 03:53 PM)_
Without a doubt :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:54 PM)_

_Emmett suddenly roundhouse kicks Sanya's stomach and hops out of her grasp._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:54 PM)_

> Sanya: Ow.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:54 PM)_

> Emmett: Die.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:54 PM)_
8ball do we finally go to the store

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 03:54 PM)_
Most likely :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh no, you've wounded me. However will i go on?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:55 PM)_
8ball Is there even a grocery store on the asteroid?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 03:55 PM)_
Outlook good :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Sanya: I see the light. Its telling me to reach out.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Garrick: Here we are.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:56 PM)_

_Iris nods._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Emmett: Woe is you, oh boo ho-

_Emmett was beginning to choke._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Iris: Alright, let's head in.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:57 PM)_

_Emmett was hitting himself in the stomach._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:57 PM)_

_The store isn't huge, but it's got a strangely wide variety of food._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_Sanya rolls away before disaster_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_The duo spend, like, 20 minutes trying to find normal meat._

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_Wemmfort starts to try to talk to emmett._

> Wemmfort: So, uh, you like glass?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_Emmett swallows, following with a visible twitch._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:58 PM)_

> Iris: Oh, there it is.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:58 PM)_

> Emmett: No more games, funny wonan.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 03:58 PM)_

> Garrick: I didn't think uncooked alien meat would look this suspicious...

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:59 PM)_

_Sanya hides behind the couch_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:59 PM)_

_Iris lifts up one of the strange meats._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 03:59 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm going to grab you now!

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 03:59 PM)_
funny wonan.@Zander

**Lili** _(22-May-20 03:59 PM)_

> Iris: I know this one!

**Brody** _(22-May-20 03:59 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh no you won't.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:00 PM)_

> Garrick: Hope you're a good judge of food, because it all looks bad to me.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:00 PM)_

_Iris nods._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:00 PM)_

> Iris: If I weren't a ribbon dancer, I'd have been a chef.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:00 PM)_

_Emmett tackles onto Sanya, trying to pick her up._

> Emmett: I have brutal strength!

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:00 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I'm getting kinda hungry.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:00 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, you certainly fulfill that role now.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:00 PM)_

_Iris smiles at him._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:01 PM)_

> Garrick: Anyways, let's get out of here.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:01 PM)_

> Iris: Thanks, that's really nice of you to say.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:01 PM)_

> Sanya: No you dont.

_She picks him up._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:01 PM)_

> Garrick: Yeah, sure.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:01 PM)_

> Emmett: What the fuck.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:01 PM)_

_She nods and goes to buy the mountain of food they picked up along the way._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:01 PM)_

> Emmett: How are you so strong?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:02 PM)_

_Sanya changes Emmett's physical properties and now he's a basketball_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:02 PM)_

> Garrick: You... have the money for all this, right?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:02 PM)_

_Iris pauses._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:02 PM)_

> Sanya: I was sent to assassinate a famous Basketball player, so i know a thing or two about THIS!

_She throws him into the kitchen_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_

> Iris: ...I do, but that's pretty much all of my money.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_
8ball does wemmfort try to find the ship?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_
Outlook not so good :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_

_Emmett braced for impact, but surprisingly, the impact wasn't too bad. He made a fake cracking noise and went dead silent._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_

> Iris: ...do you wanna just steal it?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_

_Garrick reaches into his pockets and pulls out 36._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_

> Garrick: Yes.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:03 PM)_

> Garrick: Good idea.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:04 PM)_

> Iris: Let's go.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:04 PM)_

> Sanya: I know you're not dead. That throw wasn't even strong enough to kill a 5 year old.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:04 PM)_

_The duo rushes out of the store, setting off alarms._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:04 PM)_

> Emmett: You fucking broke my arm though.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:04 PM)_

_Iris laughs._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:04 PM)_

> Sanya: Good. Breaking bones builds character.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:04 PM)_

> Iris: I've never stolen anything before! This is kinda fun.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:05 PM)_

_Sanya turns into a wizard and turns a random baby into a beer bottle_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:05 PM)_

> Garrick: Isn't it?? Nobody else gets the thrill!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:05 PM)_

_Emmett howled in pain to try and get more of a reaction._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:05 PM)_
8ball does a weird-looking crater attract the attention of Garrick

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:05 PM)_
Outlook good :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:05 PM)_

> Sanya: Nice howl. i give it a 6.5 ot of 10.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_

> Emmett: You're boring.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_
8ball good job kiddo?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_
8ball do Iris and Garrick ride a shopping cart into the crater

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_
My sources say no :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_

> Sanya: You're drunk.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_

_Emmett turned his back on her._

> Emmett: I'm going to find some real ffriends.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_
8ball what

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_
Outlook not so good :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:06 PM)_

> Sanya: The only one out there... is Olag.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:07 PM)_
8ball do the ducks arrive at the crater at a similar time as the other two?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:07 PM)_
As I see it, yes :8ball:

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:07 PM)_
8baby

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:07 PM)_
8ball Does Garrick also see a pink blur in his peripheral vision?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:07 PM)_
It is decidedly so :8ball:

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:07 PM)_
No, you are poop.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:08 PM)_

_Emmett sighed._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:08 PM)_

> Emmett: Fine. You want me to tell you why I'mm sso drunk?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:08 PM)_

> Emmett: Or cann you tell?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:09 PM)_

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:09 PM)_
8poop

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:09 PM)_
No, you are poop.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:09 PM)_

_Emmett looked to the side, visibly embarrassed._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:09 PM)_

> Emmett: It's that time, y'know?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:10 PM)_
8ball 8poop

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:10 PM)_
Yes :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:10 PM)_
8ball do the two fall down the crater pit, leaving the groceries behind

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:10 PM)_
As I see it, yes :8ball:

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Iris: ow.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:11 PM)_

_The ducks arrive just in time to see the other two falling down into the crater_

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:11 PM)_

> Burner: Those weren't two people from the ship, were they?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:11 PM)_

_Emmett sat down next to Sanya, albeit sloppily._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Garrick: I'd call that a successful escape.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

_Diver quacks back_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

_Iris laughs._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

_Garrick looks up to see a figure looming above the hole._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Iris: I guess it was!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Emmett: I can't control it, you read up on Squoatling biology or wwhatevver.

**Sean** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

_Seth does the woah on minorities_

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Burner: So I guess we gotta go down, come on then

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:12 PM)_

_The ducks begin to slowly fly down the crater_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:13 PM)_

_Iris also looks up._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Iris: That is... a long way back to the groceries.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Garrick: Well.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_

_Iris shrugs._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Iris: I can climb.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Garrick: 'Cause I can get up there just fine.

8ball does wemmfort look for the ship?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_
As I see it, yes :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Garrick: That's no fun though.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:14 PM)_

_Emmett sat there, listening to the weirdos climbing a near-indefinitely deep crater._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Iris: Alright, what do you suggest?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:15 PM)_

_wemmfort searches frantically for the ship._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:15 PM)_

_Garrick looks over and sees that the hole goes deeper._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Garrick: I suggest we go that way.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:16 PM)_

_Iris considers it._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Sanya: I see. Have you tried murder? it works for me.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:16 PM)_

_The sound of flapping wings fills the cavern_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Emmett: Murrderr is wrong.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Garrick: Hey Sanya.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:17 PM)_

> Iris: If we could get back to the ship with the groceries before dinner, I don't see why not.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:17 PM)_

> Sanya: Yes, ghost?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:17 PM)_

> Emmett: I just really want to bang ssomething.

_Emmett muttered._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:17 PM)_

> Garrick: If you stop hearing from us, we died in a crater by the grocery store.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:17 PM)_

> Garrick: Come retrieve our bodies.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Emmett: Is Iris there?

**Sean** _(22-May-20 04:18 PM)_

_Seth pees, filling up the crater with piss_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Iris: Yeah, I'm here.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:19 PM)_

_Unfortunately, Seth ran out of pee eventually, only creating a 5" pool._

**Sean** _(22-May-20 04:20 PM)_

_seth starts to poop to fill in the gaps_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:20 PM)_

> Garrick: Gross, let's get outta here!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:20 PM)_

> Emmett: Can you guys get me some munchies or something?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:20 PM)_

_Iris nods in agreement._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:20 PM)_

> Iris: We bought a bunch of food already, we'll be back soon.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:21 PM)_

> Sanya: I can't really help you with that problem. Why not look around this trash heap for something to help?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:21 PM)_

> Emmett: That's just sick.

**Sean** _(22-May-20 04:21 PM)_

_Seth poops in every single one of Garrick's ears_

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:22 PM)_
square

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Iris: Let's get out of this crater.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett get really upset and leave?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_
Signs point to yes :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: Get awway from me.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Surely it's connected to another one somewhere. We just gotta find it.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm dissgusting.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

_Iris nods._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Iris: I'll follow you, then.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

_The ducks land and perch on the rocks, a few feet above the pair_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

_Sanya give a confused look at him._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Sanya: Are you alright?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Burner: You two good?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:24 PM)_

_Emmett runs off, frustrated and confused._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:25 PM)_
8ball do the two run off deeper into the cave

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:25 PM)_
Signs point to yes :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:25 PM)_

_Emmett is now inconveniently placed on the edge of the crater, due to him running away._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:25 PM)_

> Burner: They must have left their ears at home, Your call Diver

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Why did the Llamanians have to do thiss to me..

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:26 PM)_

_Diver starts running down the path after Iris and Garrick_

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:26 PM)_

> Burner: Of course you ran after them.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:26 PM)_

_Burner follows Diver_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:27 PM)_

_Sanya walks after her distressed friend._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:27 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm the only Squoatling left and I'm a ssad heap of trash.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:27 PM)_

_Iris hums while they walk through the cave._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:28 PM)_
(By the way everyone can hear the bumbling man)

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:28 PM)_

_Emmett leans in closer to the crater._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Emmett: I wonder how deep it goes.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:28 PM)_
8ball does the cavern begin to shake rapidly?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:28 PM)_
My sources say no :8ball:

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Iris: Very deep.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:29 PM)_

_Uncharacteristically, mostly because he's drunk and irrational_

> Emmett: Deep enough to end my missery?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Garrick: Watch out for whatever bugs might live in the trash.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Iris: no.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Iris: And yeah, I will.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:30 PM)_

_Wemmfort is still looking for the ship._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Emmett: I just wissh someone could understund or something.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_Diver jumps at Iris, knocking her to the ground_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_impact noise_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:31 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett fall down the pit?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:31 PM)_
Very doubtful :8ball:

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Burner: Diver, what the hell?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_Burner appears a bit behind them_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:32 PM)_

_Emmett lies down, his legs dangling over the pit._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:32 PM)_

_Diver quacks sadly and hops off Iris_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Iris: Hey, Diver.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

_Sanya passes by the grocery store, and notices the buggy._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

_Diver does a happy quack_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Sanya: This is ours, right?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

_Iris stands again, brushing herself off._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Burner: Oh, this is why you wanted to chase them, got it.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Emmett: Wonder how everyone would feel if I was gone. I mean, the GU wants me dead.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Iris: Yeah please take the groceries back to the ship for me.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Burner: What are you two even trying to find down here?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Garrick: Yeah, we left them up there in our escape.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Emmett: I'd just be giving into their demands.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll take them back to the ship.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Iris: A way out.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Iris: Also adventure, I think.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Burner: But couldn't he just float out and drop a rope for you?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:34 PM)_
8ball does Wemmfort give up?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:34 PM)_
Without a doubt :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Garrick: Can it, duck.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I give up.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

_Sanya, taking the cart, notices Emmett_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: Would the crew even care? Seth's even tried to kill me a few times and Sanya has a heart of stone.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Anyway, where is everybody?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Garrick: I'm just trying to find some excitement on this shithole asteroid we're stuck on.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

_Diver lowers his body and starts growling_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Iris: Hey, calm down guys.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: No one is even responding to me. Though, they may have be turned down.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I think I'm lost.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Garrick: Are you done, Emmett?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:36 PM)_

_Emmett's clearly sobered up by this point._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:36 PM)_

_Iris has Emmett turned down._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Emmett: Are there any stalagmites or something down there I can aim for?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Garrick: If you died, we'd have no pilot or acting captain.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Burner: Diver calm down, we need the ship to get off this place.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Garrick: You'd land in pee anyways.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

_Sanya walks over to the goat._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Emmett: Why is there piss down there?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Sanya: What are you doing?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

_Wemmfort lays on the ground, feeling upset._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Garrick: Divine intervention.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

_Diver straightens up and returns to his normal self_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

_Emmett turns around._

> Emmett: Oh, hey.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Emmett: What do you want?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:38 PM)_

_Iris sighs, gesturing to the trash cave._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:38 PM)_

_She picks him up and puts him in the shopping cart._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Iris: Should we go now?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Sanya: Talk to me. What's wrong?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm your plaything, that's one thing that's wrong.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:39 PM)_
8ball does Iris find a usable flashlight among the trash

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:39 PM)_
Don't count on it :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:39 PM)_

_Emmett crosses his arms._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Sanya: That doesn't normally bother you. You're just hiding behind small issues.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Iris: Can we just... keep going?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Iris: Please?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_
8ball Up ahead in the crater, are there booby traps?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_
My reply is no :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_
8ball does the group come across booby traps

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_
My reply is no :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Emmett: Small issues?!

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Burner: Yeah we should, let me and Diver lead, we can see in the dark. Kinda

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Emmett: My whole race is dead!

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:41 PM)_

> Iris: Okay.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:41 PM)_

> Sanya: And there is the big issue.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:41 PM)_

> Emmett: The whole GU wants me captured and potentially murdered!

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:41 PM)_

_Iris turns Emmett up a little, enough to catch what he's saying from time to time._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:41 PM)_

_Burner moves to the front, Diver a little bit behind her_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:41 PM)_

> Emmett: The llamanians want to decapitate me and make my head their mantlepiece!

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Sanya: Now, is me being playful really bothering you compared to that?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Iris: Garrick are you coming?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Emmett: ... No.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Garrick: Yeah, sorry, I just thought I heard something from behind us.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Emmett: It just makes me feel less masculine.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:43 PM)_

_He catches up._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:43 PM)_
8ball do the ducks find a large, open cavern filled with ruins?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:43 PM)_
Yes :8ball:

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Wemmfort: What do I do?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Just lay here, hopelessly?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Iris: Wow.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_
he was looking for the ship

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Burner: Hopefully theres an exit somewhere

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Sanya: Then it's a small issue. If you want to talk about everything, don't say that the small things are bothering you.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Sanya: You have to start with the big things.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Iris: This is so cool.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Burner: I doubt anything would settle down here without at least one surface exit

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

_Iris goes ahead a bit, wandering around the ruins in amazement._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Garrick: Weird... who would want to settle down here?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:44 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm pretty irrational when I'm hard as a boulder.

_Emmett still hasn't remembered to turn off his comms._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Burner: I can scan the area hold on

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Sanya: Comms are on. Might not want to talk about that.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:45 PM)_

> Iris: Gross, Emmett.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:46 PM)_

_Burner takes flight and starts scanning the cavern, this leaves Diver alone, poking through rubble with his beak_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:47 PM)_

> Iris: See anything cool, Diver?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:47 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya start putting the groceries up?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:47 PM)_
Yes, definitely :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:47 PM)_

_Emmett paused for a moment and turned off his comm._

> Emmett: I mean, it really isn't that much of an issue when most of the crew has seen me naked.

_He was clearly trying to push off his embarrassment._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:47 PM)_

_Diver looks over and quacks, then keeps trying to dig something out_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:47 PM)_

_Sanya puts Emmett on the counter and starts to put up groceries._

> Sanya: I guess that's right.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:48 PM)_

_Iris heads over and helps him dig._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:48 PM)_

_Emmett, playing along, kicks his legs as he's on the counter._

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:48 PM)_
8ball does wemmfort get up?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:48 PM)_
You may rely on it :8ball:

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:49 PM)_
8ball booby traps?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:49 PM)_
Outlook good :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:49 PM)_

> Sanya: I understand what you mean. Things are hard for you.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:49 PM)_

_wemmfort gets up_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:49 PM)_

> Emmett: But yeah, I drank and drank and drank to try and hide this... "Hardness". Clearly didn't work.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:49 PM)_

_Muffled beeping starts to play._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:50 PM)_

_Iris' eyes widen and she reels back._

> Iris: Diver get away from there!

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:50 PM)_

> Garrick: Back up!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:50 PM)_

> Emmett: I never had this experience, you know.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:50 PM)_

_Diver, being incredibly stubborn, refuses to move away_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:51 PM)_

> Sanya: What, pain or horny?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:51 PM)_

> Emmett: No real grocery stores or family facilities on Vortox-56.

_Emmett ignored her response._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:51 PM)_

_Iris tries to scoop up Diver and take him away from the bomb._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:51 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, the counter.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:52 PM)_

_The pile of trash explodes, with Iris and Diver barely being caught in the blast._

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:52 PM)_

_Wemmfort walks towards the sun, because that's where he assumes they are.\*\*He ends up getting even more lost._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:52 PM)_

> Emmett: Are you still on your comms?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:52 PM)_
t!roll d20

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:52 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, I am. Hm.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:53 PM)_
Wemmfort can speak youtube

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:53 PM)_

> Iris: Ouch!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:53 PM)_
8ball Does the A Plot involve the cheese ruins, wherein at its heart lies the king, Biggus Cheesus?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:53 PM)_
As I see it, yes :8ball:

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:53 PM)_

_the explosion brings Burner down from flight_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:53 PM)_

> Iris: Are you okay?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:53 PM)_

_Iris looks worriedly down at Diver._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:54 PM)_

> Garrick: Are YOU okay? Those burns look bad!

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:54 PM)_

> Iris: I've had worse.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:54 PM)_

> Burner: Diver are you okay?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:54 PM)_

_Diver quacks, sounding a little dazed_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

_Emmett smiled softly, slowly forgetting his frustrations._

> Emmett: Are we done shopping yet, Plant-squom?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_
t!choose med kit|water bottle|whole rotisserie chicken|paper shreds

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_
🤔 | [RP]retribution, I pick med kit

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

> Sanya: Sure.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

> Burner: Wait, why the FUCK were you not using your armor?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

> Garrick: Lucky!

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

_Garrick pulls out a med kit from his pockets._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:55 PM)_

> Garrick: I don't know how to use any of this!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:56 PM)_

> Emmett: You were supposed to say that we were almost finished despite having a million groceries left.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:56 PM)_

_Diver quacks in response_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:56 PM)_

_Iris laughs, though it sounds pretty strained._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:56 PM)_

> Iris: I do.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 04:56 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh. Why?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:56 PM)_

> Burner: What do you mean you didn't think it would be a landmine?!

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 04:56 PM)_

_Wemmfort stumbles on the ground from stress on his back and coughs._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:57 PM)_

> Burner: What were you expecting? A lottery ticket?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:57 PM)_

_Garrick is still paranoid._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:57 PM)_

> Garrick: Emmett, did you happen to see anyone else down here when you were brooding earlier?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:59 PM)_
8ball did the explosion reveal a tunnel?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 04:59 PM)_
Most likely :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 04:59 PM)_
emet

**Zander** _(22-May-20 04:59 PM)_

_Emmett's comms are off._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 04:59 PM)_

_Iris examines her arms with a grimace._

> Iris: That's gonna make it hard to make dinner.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 04:59 PM)_

_Diver quacks and points with a wing towards a newly opened tunnel_

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:00 PM)_
I am zander 2 in dotishtale

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:00 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:00 PM)_

> Garrick: Sanya. Ask Emmett if we were followed.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:00 PM)_

_Iris stands, stumbling a bit but catching herself._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:00 PM)_

_The pink blurr is more apparent._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:01 PM)_

_Garrick looks back again, but finds nothing behind them._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:01 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett, Garrick is asking if you saw anything while brooding.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:01 PM)_

> Emmett: It's like an Earth family thing. Seth told me of how children don't really like to shop-

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:01 PM)_

> Garrick: This is new. I've never been so paranoid like this before.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:01 PM)_

> Sanya: You might want to turn your comms back on.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:01 PM)_

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:01 PM)_

> Burner: Wait how many of us are there?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:02 PM)_

> Iris: Uh... four, I think.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:02 PM)_

> Emmett: And no, I like what we have here.

_Emmett hopped in the cart again._

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:02 PM)_
My reply is no :8ball:

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:02 PM)_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya return the Cart?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_
Yes :8ball:

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_

_Iris laughs nervously._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_

_A sudden flash occurred within the ruins, akin to a picture being taken._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_

> Sanya: C'mon. We're returning this.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_

> Emmett: What, you want me to walk?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_

_Sanya starts the walk to the crater with Emmett in the cart._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:03 PM)_

> Garrick: WHO'S THERE?

_Garrick snaps back around._

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:04 PM)_

_The ducks' armor immediately snap shut_

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:04 PM)_

> Burner: What the fuck was that?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:04 PM)_

_Garrick pulls out a laser pistol._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:04 PM)_

_Iris smiles nervously._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:04 PM)_

> Iris: Am I the only one here with a lot of enemies, or...?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:05 PM)_

_Diver begins growling loudly_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:05 PM)_

_She pulls out her dagger._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:05 PM)_

_Garrick somehow had some moisture on him, as if something gave him a quick and sloppy lick._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:05 PM)_

> Garrick: Come out! I'll-

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:06 PM)_
8ball do the people come out

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:06 PM)_
My sources say no :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:06 PM)_

_Garrick shudders, clearly shocked that he was somehow touched._

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:06 PM)_
He's lost

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:06 PM)_

> Emmett: "Garrrrick...."

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:06 PM)_

> Iris: Garrick are you okay?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:07 PM)_

_Garrick looks around, pointing his gun outwards, trying to find the source._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:07 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, you should seriously see my hooves.

_Emmett, bored from Sanya's idleness, pushed his feet in her face._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:07 PM)_

> Garrick: Come on! I'll take you on!

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:08 PM)_

_Burner's rifle pops out_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:08 PM)_

> Emmett: "Oh... how quaint..."

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:08 PM)_

> Sanya: I'm trying to steer this thing to the crater. I can't do that with your hooves in my face.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:08 PM)_

_A vacuum cleaner turns on in the distance._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:08 PM)_

_Iris holds her dagger steady, eyes scanning for danger._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:08 PM)_

> Iris: This could be worse.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:09 PM)_

> Emmett: Have you ever admired my hooves though? They're very smooth. I take care of them diligently.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:09 PM)_

> Iris: We could have no idea how to get out of here.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:09 PM)_

> Emmett: "I've been watching you for a loooooooong time."

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:09 PM)_

> Burner: Lets get the ghost back then get out of here, I'm in no mood for a fight

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:09 PM)_

> Sanya: That's great Emmett, please get them out of my face.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:10 PM)_

> Garrick: What's your deal? Did I rob you or something?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:10 PM)_

> Iris: Garrick we should go.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:10 PM)_

> Garrick: If you've got a grudge, we can settle it right now!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:10 PM)_

_Emmett got them out of her face and rested them on her shoulders, his horns propping him atop of the grate of the shopping cart._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:10 PM)_

> Emmett: "What do you want most in life, ghost?"

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:11 PM)_

> Burner: Gary, we need to go.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:11 PM)_

_Garrick has an arrogant look on his face._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:11 PM)_

> Garrick: Right now, I want you to piss off.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:12 PM)_
8ball does wemmfort sink into the ground and find the crew?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:12 PM)_
Without a doubt :8ball:

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:12 PM)_

_Iris sighs helplessly._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:12 PM)_

> Iris: Y'know what? Screw it.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:13 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm really a work of art.

_Emmett tossed his shirt at Sanya's face, the cart nearing the crater._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:13 PM)_
8ball do they come out yet

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:13 PM)_
Yes :8ball:

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:13 PM)_

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:13 PM)_

_Wemmfort sinks into the trash-ridden ground, and is now where his crew members are._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_
8ball Does the pink being reveal herself?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_
Very doubtful :8ball:

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Iris: You get used to it!

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Sanya: Put your shirt back on.

_She throws it back at him_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Emmett: "Come on. Guess who it is."

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Emmett: Paint me, plant woman.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Burner: You! From the wall! Identify yourself!

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Let me guess. korbo? the pink guy who sucks people for money?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Garrick: You expect me to remember all the names of my targets?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:15 PM)_

> Sanya: I can't paint. Art was never a strong suit.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:15 PM)_

_Iris snorts._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:15 PM)_

_Emmett looked down at his chest, regaining a bit of his self-confidence._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:15 PM)_

> Iris: Hey, guys... weren't there three extra people in here?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:16 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, what would you do if I threw my pants at you?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:16 PM)_

> Burner: I think we just found one

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:16 PM)_

> Sanya: Throw them away and make you go naked.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:16 PM)_

> Burner: Two more apparently

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Emmett: I mean, you'd want to put the crew at risk of getting distracted by my hot bod?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Burner: We still don't know if Mr.Wall is friendly or not, do we?

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_
8ball does Garrick start shooting sporadically

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_
Without a doubt :8ball:

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Iris: Please don't let any of them be from the group that blew up my planet.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Sanya: You might catch some unwanted attention.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Emmett: "Oh come on, Garrick. I'll give you a hint."

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Burner: Get to cover he's actually lost it!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:18 PM)_

_The being flashed ahead of him._

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:18 PM)_
Came out of the floor, actually

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:18 PM)_

_The ducks dive for cover_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:18 PM)_

> Emmett: "I'm a ghost too!"

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:18 PM)_
8ball does the monster reveal itself to the others?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:18 PM)_
My reply is no :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:19 PM)_

_Emmett tossed his pants at Sanya, seriously trying to get her to mess with him._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:19 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya & Cart fall into the pit?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:19 PM)_
As I see it, yes :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:19 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, that narrows it down, but I don't remember any pink ghosts!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:19 PM)_

> Emmett: "And I have a clubhouse, Garrick."

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:19 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett, you-

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:19 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Is he still drunk?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:20 PM)_

> Iris: Garrick we cant fight ghosts like you can, we need to go.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:20 PM)_

_Emmett is startled by the sudden descent and he latches onto Sanya._

> Emmett: Sanya, aim for that cushiony area!

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Garrick: Then get outta here!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Emmett: "You joined it when we were just little kids."

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

_Iris rolls her eyes._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Garrick: Now I know someone's following me.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Iris: Like I'm just gonna leave without you.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Emmett: "And I've been trying to find you ever since."

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

_Sanya lands in the soft spot with a thud, despite it being soft._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Sanya: Ow.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:22 PM)_

> Garrick: That doesn't even make any sense!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:22 PM)_

> Emmett: "You didn't receive your reward!"

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:22 PM)_

> Burner: At this point we should just go

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:22 PM)_

> Sanya: Hey, we fell, where are you?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:23 PM)_
8ball is wemmfort here with everyone?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:23 PM)_
My sources say no :8ball:

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:23 PM)_

_Emmett was shivering from the depths._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:23 PM)_

> Iris: backup, we need immediate backup.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:23 PM)_

> Sanya: Then tell us where you are.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:23 PM)_

> Emmett: I swear, I choose the worst times to mess around.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:24 PM)_

> Burner: If we're staying can we at least know what's causing the ghost to go mad?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:24 PM)_
8ball does Iris suddenly have the ability to punch ghosts

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:24 PM)_
Yes, definitely :8ball:

8ball Does the being now reveal herself to Garrick?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:24 PM)_
Outlook not so good :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:24 PM)_

> Sanya: Are you people even listening?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:25 PM)_

> Iris: Forward! We're forward!

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:25 PM)_

> Sanya: Come on, Emmett. We're heading down the cave.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:25 PM)_

_wemmfort figures out that he in fact isn't with the crew. The fake crew reveals themselves as bemmit, shangya, Lyrus, Deevrr, Burngner, and Garry Hickman._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:25 PM)_

_The pink ghost shows herself to Garrick, with a visible Mickey Mouse mask and all._

> Emmett: "It's yo' boy, Gretta!"

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:25 PM)_

_Sanya grabs Emmett and starts running._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm f-freezing!

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Wemmfort: You people are incorrect.

_Wemmfort starts to find the real crew._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Garrick: What's your problem??

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Garrick: What do you want from me?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Sanya: Next time, keep your clothes on.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Sanya: We're nearly there.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:27 PM)_

> Emmett: "I love you Garrick! I always have!"

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:27 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I might have swallowed some grass while coming down here.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:27 PM)_

_The ducks have moved to the tunnel entrance waiting to see what happens next_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:27 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, at least you answered and stopped being cryptic.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:27 PM)_

> Emmett: Well, I still am a little tipsy. I hid it well from you though.

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:27 PM)_

> Iris: Oh, that's an unexpected twist.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:27 PM)_

_Sanya and a naked Emmett arrive to meet the rest of the crew._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Emmett: Plus, I didn't think you were such a reckless cart driver!

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Sanya: Sorry, what did we miss?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Emmett: Let me push you around like a kid!

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Iris: Yeah but who was the other person?

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:28 PM)_

_wemmfort falls on the ground and hallucinates himself convulsing into the air._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:28 PM)_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:29 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:29 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, bad news, lady.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett: "I can see right through you, future boyfriend!"

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:29 PM)_
Where has seth been all this time?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett: "I replaced your pistol with a nerf gun!"

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:29 PM)_

> Garrick: Even if I _was_ into you, the whole stalking thing is a bit of a turn-off.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:30 PM)_

> Sanya: What is happening?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:30 PM)_
8ball does Garrick have explosive nerf darts in his pocket dimension?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:30 PM)_
Very doubtful :8ball:

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:30 PM)_

_Garrick tries to shoot at the other ghost, but it shoots a foam bullet instead._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:30 PM)_

> Garrick: ...oh.

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:30 PM)_

> Sanya: Nice shot.

**Cooldude** _(22-May-20 05:31 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Woah, it's a mythical Squeaky Chicken!> Wemmfort: "Dig! Dig!"> Wemmfort: It's really real!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:31 PM)_

_Emmett leans on Sanya and watches the awkward ghost conversation._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:31 PM)_

> Garrick: How about helping us out, Sanya?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:31 PM)_

_Iris accidentally punches Garrick's arm._

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:33 PM)_

_She is not knocked unconscious, but the pistol is knocked out of her hand._

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:33 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, throwing a punch.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:33 PM)_

> Garrick: Yes! Grab the gun please!

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:33 PM)_

_Iris shrugs and grabs the gun._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:33 PM)_

_Suddenly, Garrick felt a punch from nowhere._

> Emmett: "I'm you, but female, Garrick."

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:33 PM)_

> Sanya: How does that work with no arms?

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:33 PM)_

_The fuck is happening?_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:34 PM)_

> Iris: Can I punch her?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:34 PM)_

> Emmett: "Punch me and you punch Garrick."

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:35 PM)_

> Garrick: Ow!

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:35 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, you want to go grab some food or something?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:35 PM)_

> Iris: ...yeah that's why I'm asking Garrick for permission.

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:35 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:35 PM)_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:35 PM)_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:36 PM)_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:36 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:36 PM)_

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:37 PM)_

> Sanya: How are we getting out?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:37 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm cold, wet, still a bit horny, and hungry. That's too many adjectives for me.

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:37 PM)_

> Burner: How about this tunnel everyone seems to have forgotten?

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:37 PM)_

> Iris: Wait if someone hits Garrick wouldn't that hurt you too?

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:38 PM)_
8ball Is the tunnel marked, in Olag's writing, "EXIT"?

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:38 PM)_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:38 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:39 PM)_

> Garrick: Yes.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:39 PM)_

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:39 PM)_

_Iris does so._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:39 PM)_

_Emmett hopped onto Sanya. He said this in a slightly sarcastic voice._

> Emmett: Sorry for getting super sad and stuff and getting us stuck down here.

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:40 PM)_
8ball does Iris pick off whatever was stuck onto his vest?

**FFBot** _(22-May-20 05:40 PM)_

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:40 PM)_
8ball Does the pink ghost suddenly open her pocket dimension, creating a vacuum?

My sources say no :8ball:

**Brody** _(22-May-20 05:40 PM)_

_Garrick sighs in relief._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:40 PM)_

> Iris: Now can I punch her??

**Trey** _(22-May-20 05:40 PM)_

_The pink ghost opens its mouth, it opening by about a fourth of a foot each second._

**Lili** _(22-May-20 05:41 PM)_

_Iris punches the ghost._

**Zander** _(22-May-20 05:41 PM)_

**Bill** _(22-May-20 05:45 PM)_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

_Emmett was blocking out the recorded message._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_
8ball does seth airlock Emmett out of the ship?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_
Very doubtful.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Seth: "Seth, your Delivery is in the back room of the main area, take anything you want"

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Garrick: New guy.

_He points to Volonta._

> Garrick: You're the janitor, you get to clean up after Emmett.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Rachell: What is a domestic line?

**Preston** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Volentina: What.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:55 PM)_

> Garrick: You. Clean up. After Emmett.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Rachell: Please, do explain, I need it for my research.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Seth: "This is Olag signing off"

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll round up the crew, go take a bath.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Seth: "Ta ta"

**Preston** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Volentina: Uh, ok. Do you have a mop?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_
8ball does Iris turn into pink olag

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_
Yes, but with a caveat decided by the person before you.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Garrick: Check the storage room.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

_The comms violently turn off_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Seth: Well everyone!

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Emmett: Whatever. I'm taking a shower. Hope none of you eat me or whatever.

_Emmett gets up into the ship and moves on to the bathroom._

**Preston** _(26-May-20 03:56 PM)_

> Volentina: Where is the storage room?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:57 PM)_

> Sanya: Everyone just get inside, or we're leaving you behind.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:57 PM)_

> Seth: This asteroid is going to blow up, I have to grab my delivery, so you guys just head over to the ship.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:57 PM)_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:57 PM)_

8ball Does Sanya all of a sudden start singing "Be a man" from Mulan?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_
Signs point to yes.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_Iris turns into pink Olag and then back into herself almost instantly._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_Emmett really felt terrible now. He waited for a bit before closing the restroom hatch._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

> Seth: Delivery is not there.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

> Seth: Its in that building

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

_Seth points at the building infront of the ship_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, crap. You're right.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 03:58 PM)_

> Emmett: Um...
> Emmett: Why me? Why is it always me?

_Emmett took off his comm watch and his translator collar._

> Emmett: Quite the bunch.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_
8ball does anyone notice the random puddle slithering towards the engine room

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_
No, but in a monotonous tone.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_

_Iris wanders back into the ship._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_

_DisneyPlanet shocks Sanya_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_

> Sanya: OW!

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_

_Garrick follows Iris and whispers a master prank to her._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_

> Garrick: Turn into Olag and walk in on Emmett.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_

_Iris snorts._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 03:59 PM)_

> Iris: You're a genius.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:00 PM)_

_Seth heads into the storage area_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:00 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, pranking is what I do.

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:00 PM)_
8ball Does Volonta find the mop

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:00 PM)_
Yup.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:00 PM)_

_Emmett takes off his shirt and and sweatpants. He then looked at himself in the mirror._

> Emmett: Squemlax fulag howler.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:00 PM)_

> Seth: Hmmmmmm

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:00 PM)_

_Iris follows Emmett's trail._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:00 PM)_

> Seth: I'm just going to take everything

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:01 PM)_

_She turns into pink Olag._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:01 PM)_
t!8ball Does Seth take everything in the room?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:01 PM)_
🎱 | Outlook good, Bagelwrecker

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:01 PM)_

> Seth: Alright, well thats all.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:01 PM)_

_D: I hate this group. They're so insane they don't fear anything anymore._

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:01 PM)_

_Volonta would soon get to work cleaning the Gelatinous feces_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:01 PM)_

_Seth walks back to the ship_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:01 PM)_

_Emmett shimmied out of his boxers and turned on the shower, entering into it._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:02 PM)_

_she opens the door just slightly._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:02 PM)_

> Iris: Hey Emmett, can I come in for a second?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:02 PM)_

> Seth: I'm back niggas!

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_

> Wemmfort: What's that word you just said? It's not in my translator's programming.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_

> Seth: I got my delivery.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_

_Emmett couldn't understand Iris. He just entered the shower and closed the curtain. The hatch wasn't locked, anyhow._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_

_she turns swiftly back into herself, getting a better idea that is less likely to upset her friend._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_
8ball does Garrick watch the shenanigans unfold from a distance

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_
It is certain.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_

> Garrick: No. Do it. Do not falter.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:03 PM)_

_Iris opens the hatch, heading inside._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:04 PM)_

> Garrick: Dewet.

_he says, in a Palpatine voice._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:04 PM)_

> Iris: Whoops, you probably can't understand me. Uhh, how do I adjust this thing...

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:04 PM)_

_She could hear a whistling tune from inside the shower._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:04 PM)_

_Seth sits on the couch and starts going over the things he got_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:05 PM)_

_She fiddles with her translator for a second, looking for the Squoatian setting._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:05 PM)_

> Iris: Uh... can you understand me now?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:06 PM)_

> Seth: Hmmm

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:06 PM)_

> Seth: Seth decides its time to go get some food

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:06 PM)_

_Emmett notices the voice and sticks a hoof out of the curtain. He grabs his translator for her and puts it on._

> Emmett: Iris?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:06 PM)_

_Seth heads to the fridge_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:06 PM)_

> Iris: That's my name.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:06 PM)_

> Seth: Seth decides he wants a carrot cake

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_

> Emmett: It's been like 4 GUYs since you've done this.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_

_Seth takes a carrot cake from the fridge_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_

_She laughs._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_

> Iris: I forgot i did this before.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_
8ball Does another ship land next to the crew's ship?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_
My sources say no.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_

> Seth: Seth decides he's going to eat the entire thing and leave none for Emmett because he acted like a bitch

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_

_Seth eats the entire carrot cake_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_
8ball Does an Escape pod crash near the ship?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_
Signs point to no.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:07 PM)_

> Garrick: Hey, can anyone else get us off of this asteroid? We only have a few minutes left.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_

> Emmett: We did have a little fling when we were younger.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_

_Emmett suds his face thoroughly._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_

_Iris' cheeks turn pink._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll see if i can start the auto-pilot.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_

_Seth's mouth turns into a vacuum cleaner as he sucks up the carrot cake whole_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_

> Iris: That was so long ago.

**Silas** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_
8ball does a Molemobile emerge from the ground near the ship?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_
N Word. (No).

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:08 PM)_

> Seth: Seth decides he's going to pilot the ship

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:09 PM)_

> Garrick: ...Sanya, can you do it?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:09 PM)_

_Sanya sits in the cockpit, realizing she has no knowledge of how to drive_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:09 PM)_

> Sanya: Seth, how do i drive this?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:09 PM)_

_Seth heads to the cockpit_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:09 PM)_

> Iris: Anyways, i came here to make sure you're okay.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:09 PM)_

> Seth: I have it my friend, says Seth.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:09 PM)_
Woah! Emmett Flower with no brim!

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Sanya: That would be an awful idea.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Seth: Seth decides he's going to show Sanya how a real pilot pilots.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Iris: I mean, that whole thing was pretty weird. Like,

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Sanya: Just tell me what buttons to press.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

_Garrick peeks into the cockpit._

> Garrick: I could try.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Seth: Seth sits in the driver seat

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

_Seth sits down_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Sanya: Get off of my lap.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

_Iris takes this moment to shift into Olag and mimick his voice, but with a really high pitch._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Seth: Next time sit in the right chair Seth says.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

> Seth: Seth turns the key

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:10 PM)_

_Seth turns the key_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

> Iris: I love you, stay safe,

_she mocks, in a very mocking tone._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

> Garrick: Shoot! I'm missing the prank!

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

_Garrick hurries off back to the bathroom._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

_Emmett scrubbed himself down and felt pretty clean. He just had to get his horns-_

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_
8ball does a ship emerge from under the asteroid and land in the station

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_
My reply is no.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

> Seth: Seth points

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

_Seth points_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

_Emmett jumped a little._

> Emmett: I thought you were dead!

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

_she turns back into herself._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_

> Sanya: Sanya is getting really tired of Seth narrating himself.

_She flips the lever_

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:11 PM)_
Seth is his own narrator

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Seth: Seth says you can go fuck yourself you stupid sunflower.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm literally taking a shower to get out of your... shit.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:12 PM)_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Seth: Seth firmly grasps the wheel

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:12 PM)_

_Seth grasps the wheel_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:12 PM)_

> Garrick: No, Iris, what are you doing?!

_He says this way louder than the whisper he intended._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll have fun taking you apart one day.

_Sanya gets up and sits in the co-pilot seat._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

_iris looks up to fix Garrick with a very monotone glare._

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

_Volonta walks up and taps on Garrick's shoulder_

> Volentina: Where do I clean this off at?

_He holds up the shit stained mop_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Seth: Flip the blue switch, says Seth

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Wemmfort throws a bottle of space juice to Seth.

**Silas** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_
8ball does a 2009 Toyota Prius drive up and park next to the ship?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_
Choose someone who decides for me.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

_Sanya flips the switch._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

_Emmett opens up the curtain a little bit. He was still covering his lower half, but his torso was definitely showing. His horns were doused in soap._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Sanya: Would it kill you to say please?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Emmett: What?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Emmett: Iris, was that you?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

> Garrick: Wait until Emmett gets out of the shower, I guess.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:13 PM)_

_The ship starts to float up_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Iris: Yeah it was.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Seth: We are launching says Seth.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Seth: Seth turns on the intercom on the ship

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

_Seth flips a switch_

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

_Volonta shrugs his shoulders and leans the mop against a wall before wandering around_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

> Seth: Seth begins speaking

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

_Iris mimics Garrick's voice but not his body._

> Iris: Don't make me do it Garrick.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:14 PM)_

_Emmett felt turbulence from the ship launching._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Garrick: Do what? What're you gonna do?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Seth: HELLO! THIS IS YOUR NEW PILOT SPEAKING! WE ARE LAUNCHING SO WE DON'T DIE. Says Seth.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

_Dakari wakes from his nap to rumbling of the ship launching and Seth's voice over the intercom_

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Emmett: I need to get out of here. Someone's flying when they're no supposed-

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

_Iris turns her face into Garrick's. Just her face, though._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

_Emmett puts on his comms._

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

_Wemmfort stumbles around the ship._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:15 PM)_

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Wemmfort didn't put his seatbelt on

_Wemmfort didn't put his seatbelt on_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

_Emmett is launched from the shower to the bathroom door._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth!

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Emmett: Get the fuck out of my seat!

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

_Seth turns on autopilot but accidently turns on disco mode in the progress_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_
Charles goes next

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Seth: Looks like it is dancing time, Seth quips.

**Silas** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_
8ball in his genuine fear, does Garrick stumble and drop something out of his pockets?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_
You may rely on it.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Seth: Seth does the funny laugh

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_

_Rachell has been slammed against one of the walls of the ship, her goopy body melting part of said wall._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_

_Seth laughs_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_
"Fake Lottery Ticket"

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_

> Rachell: This is... interesting.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_

_Seth hops off the seat_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_

_Iris quickly covers her eyes once she notices that Emmett is out of the shower._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_

> Seth: Thats enough of that

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_
8ball Does Wemmfort attempt to put a seatbelt on?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:17 PM)_
Yes, but in a monotonous tone.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Seth: Emmett, we're heading to Station 30-x2.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

_Emmett clearly didn't care that he was naked. He stormed over to the cockpit._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Emmett: This is my spot, dumbshit.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I am going to put on my seatbelt.> Wemmfort: I am safe now.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

_Seth jolts the ship forward again_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Sanya: Put on a towel, you're indecent.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Seth: Don't come in the cockpit with your cock out.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Seth: Thats my job.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:18 PM)_

_Emmett is jostled onto Sanya from the sudden jolt._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_

> Seth: Now, y'all have fun.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_

_Iris follows him, stumbling a bit on occasion._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_

> Sanya: Get off. You're getting my outfit wet.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_

> Emmett: You're going to destroy my baby! Get handling her that way!

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_
8ball does Vargas go to space station 30-x2

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_
Spell it with me now, N-O.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:19 PM)_

_Emmett hops off of Sanya, and as Seth specified, his cock was a little out._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_

> Seth: She'll live man.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_

_Garrick returns to his room to log the failure of his prank._

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_

_Rachel takes a peek at the cockpit her face still absorbing some of that metal that stuck to her earlier._

> Rachell: What is happening? Please report.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_
8ball does Iris throw a towel at Emmett

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_
No, but something that the person after you decides upon happens.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_

> Seth: I handled her like this way before you ever were born.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_

> Sanya: Seth's driving the same way he lives: Recklessly.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth's ruining my ship.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:20 PM)_

_Emmett was flaccid and clearly upset._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:21 PM)_

> Seth: Im not but ok

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:21 PM)_
8ball Do I walk up on Emmett and Iris' fiasco?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:21 PM)_
Of course not!

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:21 PM)_

> Rachell: I think one of the walls may have a hole in it now.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:21 PM)_

_Dakari walking towards the cockpit_

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:21 PM)_

> Dakari: What are you guys doing, and why is Emmett butt naked?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Emmett: Oh.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Emmett: Hello then.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Stop looking at him.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Iris: Clothes, Emmett!

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Sanya: Seth decided to drive.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

_Emmett looks down and shrugs._

> Emmett: Well, Seth did decide to drive.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Dakari: We're doomed then.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Rachell: What is that flesh wand, Emmett?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Emmett: I mean, can someone grab me my clothes from-

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Emmett: Flesh... Wand?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

_Garrick returns to the cockpit, pulls out some pants, and throws them at Emmett._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_
8ball does anyone seem to notice the sentient water slithering around their ship?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_
Yes.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Pants.

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Volentina: What the fuck is this

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: That's what we call a Dick in my culture.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Rachell: Yes, that thing, between you legs, my research must continue.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Sanya: Don't even try it, weirdo.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Rachell: I must examine it, now.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

_Iris chokes a bit on air, cheeks turning red._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

_moves around as a puddle_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Seth might let you examine him.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Iris: Guys can you please stop talking about Emmett's dick??

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Emmett: It's my cock.

_The pants were clearly too small. He, using the pants like a sockpuppet, covered his willy._

**Silas** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_
haha penis

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

_Volonta grabs the mop and readies it to clean the puddle_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Garrick: No, it's the topic of conversation right now. Get over it.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Emmett: This is not like the typical jobs I'd sign up for.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_
I'm in pain

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

_runs away from the mop_

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Rachell: The 'Seth' person is quite creepy, please, keep him away from me.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

_Seth turns up the speed on the ship_

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

_Volonta chases the puddle_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Seth: Emmett, turn on the warp drive for me

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Emmett: We have moving water-

_Emmett slid to another wall._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:24 PM)_

> Sanya: Hey, she got lesson 1 of the Vortox Pummelers down.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:25 PM)_

> Seth: I don't think Olag unwrapped it yet

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:25 PM)_

_Iris holds her hand out to Rachell._

> Iris: I don't think we've officially met, my name is Iris!

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:25 PM)_

_moves between Emmett's legs_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:25 PM)_

> Emmett: The fuck is that thing?

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:25 PM)_

_runs towards the kitchen_

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:25 PM)_

> Volentina: Sentient puddle. I have no fucking clue.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:25 PM)_

> Emmett: OKAY, OKAY.

_Emmett stands up._

> Emmett: Who wants to go with me to the engine room?

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

_He chases again_

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

_Rachell looks at Iris, then her hand, it's a blank unfeeling stare._

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

> Dakari: You know what, I'll go.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

> Rachell: Hello, Iris.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

_moves under Volonta and tries to trip him_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

_Iris turns her head towards Emmett._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

> Iris: I'll go!

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

> Dakari: I've been awake for 5 minutes, and I already need a break.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Let's go, Iris and Dakari.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:26 PM)_

_She retracts her hand before looking at Rachell._

> Iris: What's your name?

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

_volonta just lifts his foot up and shoves the mop down towards the puddle_

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

> Rachell: Rachell, that is my designation.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

_Vargas wanders around deep space for a bit._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

_Iris smiles._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

_Emmett was now awkwardly erect, the pants moving upward._

> Emmett: Can we get going?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll stay here and make sure Seth doesn't kill us all.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_
8ball Does Rachell attempt physical contact with Iris?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_
Outlook bad.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

> Iris: Nice to meet you Rachell, I've gotta go!

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:27 PM)_

> Dakari: Let's

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Garrick: Yo. Valantia.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

_separates so the mop doesn't hit him_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Garrick: Where are you?

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Volentina: Trying to mop up an unmoppable puddle

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Iris: We'll talk later though, okay?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_
`

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_
8ball Does Garrick get stuck in his own pocket?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_
Yes, but with a caveat decided by the next person.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

_starts rising to reveal his Torrid form_

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

_Rachell gives Iris another blank stare._

> Rachell: Ok, if you suffer any psychological or physical damage, procure my assistance.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:28 PM)_

_Walks off towards the engine room, looking around for any slimy changes._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Theylin: HELLO!

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Theylin: HOW ARE YOU?!

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Garrick: Okay, well, when you get done, I have a job for you.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Vargas: I see a person flying like a a maniac.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Garrick: It's easy.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

_Iris nods, smiling as she jogs backwards._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Theylin: CAN. YOU. HEAR. ME!?

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_
8ball Does Dakari notice any notable sliminess in the engine room?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_
Without a doubt.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Iris: Alright, i will!

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

_Vargas sees a person flying like a maniac._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Theylin: I. AM. PEACEFUL!

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Volentina: So you aren't a puddle. Figures.

_Volonta stops trying to mop up the 'puddle'_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Emmett: Oh my Squoat.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:29 PM)_

_She turns to follow Emmett properly._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Emmett: Why did he ruin everything?

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Dakari: I think your friend left quite a gift for you Emmett...

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Theylin: CAN. YOU. UNDERSTAND. MY. SPEAK?!

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:30 PM)_

_Volonta then goes to find Garrick_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Garrick: What's the deal, Emmett?

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:30 PM)_

_follows the newcomer_

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:30 PM)_

_Rachell keeps following Emmett, well, more like stalking him._

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Vargas: That ship almost hit me!

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Sanya: Well, Seth, what's at this station we're heading to?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_
8ball does Emmett turn into a marble?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_
I guess so.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_Emmett shivered._

> Emmett: Stay in here for me. I'm getting my clothes on. I don't want anymore of Olag's stuff on me. Especially not my....

_Emmett rolled away to the restroom before finishing his statement._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Seth: Its a pirate station

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Theylin: CAN. ANYONE. SHOW. ME. TO. THIS. SHIP'S. CAPTAIN?!

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_Iris nods._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Iris: Yeah I'll wait here.

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_Volonta tapped on Garrick's shoulder_

> Volentina: You needed me?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:32 PM)_

_Volonta's hand phases through Garrick, and Volonta falls through him._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:32 PM)_

> Sanya: Pirates? I may have to wait this one out.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:32 PM)_

_wanders around the ship_

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:32 PM)_

_Vargas follows that ship to cuss out their pilot._

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:32 PM)_

> Volentina: Oh. Uh. Sorry?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:32 PM)_

> Seth: No no no

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

_Emmett turns back into himself and puts his clothes back on. In particular, he was wearing the red sweater with the yellow shoulder pads. He then left to the engine room._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Garrick: Yeah, I need you in the storage room again.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Seth: By pirate station I mean its not GU oriented.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

_wanders around the ships, seemingly stumbling into an engine room_

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Volentina: Does it require the mop? If so I'd need to clean it.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Garrick: No.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Garrick: Come.

_Garrick trails off towards the storage room._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Theylin: HELLO?! I. COME. IN. PEACE!

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

_Volonta began to follow Garrick_

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Theylin: WHERE. IS. THE. SHIP'S. CAPTAIN?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

_He nudged Iris kiddingly._

> Emmett: I mean, I'm just too hot for you guys to handle.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Emmett: Dakari.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Emmett: Can you pave a way to the warp drive?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:34 PM)_

_Iris chuckles._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, that's better. I had a hit on a big wig Pirate in my early days. People still hunt me out for it.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Dakari: Yea, no problem I suppose.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:34 PM)_

_just looks around the... lack-luster engine room_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:34 PM)_

_Garrick points towards a huge pile of overflowing boxes._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Garrick: So, that's gotta go. Do you know how to use the airlock?

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_

_mumbles_

> Theylin: not the greatest engine

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_
8ball Does the warp drive get set into place?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_
Outlook bad.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: Olag's an idiot.

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Volentina: I can't say I do. Never been on a ship, so it's safe to say no.

**Hunter** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_

_There are two holes inside the ship shaped like Rachell's face, do not question them._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: He didn't even get this put in.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:35 PM)_

_Iris nods, turning into pink Olag._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Garrick: Hmm... well, we can take care of that later, I guess.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Vargas: Vargas starts to contact the dumbass drivers ship.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Iris: I'm Olag and I fixed your ship and I'm charging 100,000 Ducketts.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Dakari: Gosh... I didn't realize you could change forms Iris.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

_Emmett sees Iris and jumps up and latches on the roof. This wasn't too hard, given lack of gravity in the engine room._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

_She turns back into herself._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Iris: You okay Emmett?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Emmett: Iris, you can shapeshift?

_He was noticeably shivering._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Iris: I couldn't change forms until, like, yesterday.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Vargas: Hello hello? Can you hear me?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Iris: Remember that thing with the pink ghost?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Emmett: Oh. That.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Dakari: No, wasn't there.

**Preston** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

_Volonta just shrugs and walks towards the bathroom to wash the mop_

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

_Seth steadily speeds up the ship_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

_Emmett falls and starts to lift the warp drive._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Emmett: Help out.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Iris: Well I kind of absorbed a ghost and now I can shapeshift and touch ghosts.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

_Garrick is interested in their conversation, and regroups with Iris and the others._

> Garrick: So, how's that going anyways?

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

_starts examining the engine_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Garrick: Is she somehow conscious?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

_Iris turns into pink Emmett._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Garrick: Any voices in your head so far?

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Dakari: That's... useful.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya leave Seth to his devices?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_
Outlook bad.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Emmett: Is that comfortable for you?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Sanya: I still don't trust you alone.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Sanya: Especially not driving.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Iris: It's basically fine except for the part where I'm pink when I'm in any form other than mine.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_
8ball does Vargas boards the wavering ship.

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_
It is certain.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Emmett: I kinda find it... hot.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Dakari: Get a room.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Garrick: Sounds like a win-win to me.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

_Emmett, despite asking for help, lifts the warp drive and sets it into place._

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Vargas: Hello?

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

_Dakari begins helping Emmett with the warp drive_

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Iris: And sometimes i have vivid dreams about being sucked into a pink void.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Dakari: My bad.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Garrick: Turn into a Squoatling and fulfill Emmett's biggest desires.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Iris: But other than that!

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

_Vargas searches for people._

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Dakari: See, you clearly had the warp drive handled.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

_Emmett was panting from the weight._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

_Iris turns back into herself, stretching._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Emmett: That's pretty realistic...

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Sanya: Seth, we got an intruder.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

_Dakari slaps Emmett on the back_

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_

> Dakari: Good job

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:40 PM)_
\*Vargas stomps his way around till he finds the cockpit
(edited)

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:41 PM)_

> Iris: Except for the part where I'm pink, it's a perfect replication.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:41 PM)_

> Emmett: Could you turn back to the Squoatling for-

_Emmett fell over from the slap._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:41 PM)_

_She changes her voice to Emmett's._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:41 PM)_

> Iris: I can do voices, too.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Emmett: That sounds nothing like me.

_Emmett's voice was muffled from the ground._

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

_Vargas finds a teleporter._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

_She laughs, still in Emmett's voice._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Seth: Hey you see that ship over there?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Iris: I'm sure it doesn't.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Seth: Wanna see me ram it?

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_
Is it my turn?

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

\*\*

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

_She reaches out to offer Emmett her hand._

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

_Seth blasts the ship to high hell_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:42 PM)_

> Sanya: Yes, Seth. Ram the ship and ignore the current intruder.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Seth: Well, now he can't escape

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

_Vargas is sent to the cockpit._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

_Looks up at her and smiles softly. He took her hand soon after._

> Emmett: Do you have the same texture and everything?

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:43 PM)_

> Seth: Oh look hes here.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:44 PM)_

_Emmett rubbed his digits on her form's horns, expecting that she didn't keep the qualities of whatever she shapeshifted into._

**Silas** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_
8ball does everyone suddenly feel the need to go to the living room?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_
As I see it, yes.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:47 PM)_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

_Garrick heads to the living room, and then the pool._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

_Emmett slapped Dakari back and laid on a couch in the living room._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

> Garrick: Sure, but not in my form, please.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:48 PM)_

> Vargas: With your level of intelligence. not possible.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:49 PM)_

> Vargas: Whos the real captain?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:49 PM)_

_Emmett was just saying this to himself._
8ball Do I walk off to tend to my belongings?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:49 PM)_
No, but something that the person before you decides upon happens.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:51 PM)_

_Iris sits at the side of the pool and dips her feet in._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:51 PM)_

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:53 PM)_

> Vargas: Wait ive met you before!

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:53 PM)_

_Emmett's words meant nothing to her, very likely._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:53 PM)_

_Garrick pulls out a re-sealed Soda Can and takes a sip._

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:53 PM)_

> Vargas: Youre the guy from the market!

> Theylin: MY. NAME. IS. THEYLIN.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:53 PM)_

> Emmett: There's tons of markets.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:54 PM)_
8ball is sanya still mad?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:54 PM)_
I guess so.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:54 PM)_

> Vargas: Weird, hi water. Nice to meet all of you.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:54 PM)_

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:55 PM)_

> Theylin: I can leave

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:55 PM)_

_Emmett stuck his tongue out at her._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:55 PM)_

> Sanya: I don't see how we can possibly trust them.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:55 PM)_

> Emmett: Let's not be so murder-hungry.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 04:55 PM)_

> Vargas: Well thanks for the invite. We got 2 ships now boys.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:55 PM)_

_Iris catches it and drinks some._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:56 PM)_

> Theylin: aight, imma be honest. I'm a trespasser and I need passage. I'm willing to offer my services to you guys if you can get me to a space port.

**Sean** _(26-May-20 04:56 PM)_
8ball Does Seth finish destroying the ship and then head to the living room?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:56 PM)_
My reply is no.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:56 PM)_

_Emmett lifted his arms up to Sanya's face and pushed her cheeks._

> Emmett: Let's make love, not war.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:56 PM)_

> Theylin: I'm a master engineer

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:56 PM)_

_It's terrible. Iris coughs._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:56 PM)_

> Sanya: War is more fun. And you're not my type.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:57 PM)_

_Emmett rolled his eyes._

> Emmett: I'm in heat and you're more of a pervert than I am.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 04:57 PM)_

> Theylin: I'm on a pilgrimage for my home, may I formally offer my services for passage?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:58 PM)_

_Sanya is unfazed by Emmett's blabbering._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:58 PM)_
8ball does Garrick use Salt Spray on Vargas

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:58 PM)_
Of course!

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:58 PM)_
8ball Does more pirates come in to save 8ball man and water boy?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:58 PM)_
Yes but actually no.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:58 PM)_

_Garrick floats up through the ceiling to spray Vargas's eyes with salt._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 04:59 PM)_

_Iris sighs._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 04:59 PM)_

_Emmett sighed and left to the pool, given that he was clearly being ignored._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 04:59 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya grab something out of dread?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 04:59 PM)_
Ja.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 04:59 PM)_

_Sanya pulls out a Emmett Disney Mask_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:00 PM)_

_Vargas's hand goes right through, obviously_

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:00 PM)_

> Sanya: Not what i was hoping for.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:00 PM)_

> Emmett: Iris, you here?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:00 PM)_

> Emmett: In the pool?

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:00 PM)_
8ball is Vargas the most liked person on the crew

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:00 PM)_

8ball Does Wemmfort pass all of his Space juice to Seth?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:01 PM)_
Yes, but with a caveat decided by the next person.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:01 PM)_

_Emmett had a mocking, sarcastic tone._

> Emmett: Sanya's bullying me and the rest of the crew are being neurotic over a puddle of water.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:01 PM)_

_Iris nods tiredly._

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 05:02 PM)_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:03 PM)_

_Emmett laid in a pool chair, near Iris._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:03 PM)_

> Emmett: Sometimes I just feel really ignored by everyone.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:04 PM)_

_Sanya follows Emmett to the pool and sits nearby._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:05 PM)_

> Garrick: Emmett, it's because you're not assertive.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:05 PM)_

> Garrick: No offense, dude, but you're kind of a pushover sometimes.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:06 PM)_

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:07 PM)_

_Vargas makes lunch for everyone as a second apology ._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:07 PM)_

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:07 PM)_

> Garrick: Look at me, I bossed around the new guy earlier even though I have absolutely no power over him.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:07 PM)_

> Vargas: Come get lunch. I made more than enough for everyone.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:07 PM)_

_Iris shrugs._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:08 PM)_

> Sanya: Listen Emmett. It's not mean to stand up for yourself. Garrick's right, you are a bit of a pushover. I've been trying to toughen you up a bit.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:08 PM)_

_Emmett was trying to discretely flex to get more blood pumping in his arms._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:13 PM)_

> Garrick: Vargas, I would get some fireproof coverings.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:13 PM)_

_Iris stiffens further and her eyes narrow at Vargas._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:13 PM)_

> Emmett: You're delusional. Sanya's sandwiches are really good.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:13 PM)_

_Emmett took a bite._

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Vargas: Oof. Thanks for the honesty though.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett, are you alright? You look off.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Emmett: What does that even mean, 8ball head?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Emmett: I just said Sanya's sandwiches are good.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:14 PM)_

_Iris is fighting the sudden urge to murder._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:14 PM)_

> Emmett: You're acting delusional.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:15 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, I'll be taking my leave.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:15 PM)_

> Iris: Sanya how do you do this all the time?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:15 PM)_

> Emmett: No.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:15 PM)_

> Emmett: You're not leaving.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:15 PM)_

> Emmett: Stay here.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:15 PM)_

> Garrick: Everyone in this room is in danger.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:15 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, the urge to murder? I just kill something else.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:15 PM)_

_Emmett's arm was shaking quickly._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:15 PM)_

> Garrick: Kill time at the pool! Hahaha.

_Garrick laughs nervously._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:15 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya attempt to pull grass out of Dread?

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:15 PM)_

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:15 PM)_
Nah.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:16 PM)_

> Emmett: What does that even mean?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:16 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm starting to get pissed off at your lack of clarity.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:16 PM)_

_Emmett was grinding his teeth a bit._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:16 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett. What is going on. You can tell me.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:17 PM)_

_Iris' eyes turn pink._

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Vargas: I'm sorry i didn't mean to offend you.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Iris: This ship already has a chef.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Garrick: Iris, can you move somewhere else?

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Vargas: I apologize i was trying to be helpful.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:17 PM)_

_Iris nods stiffly._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Garrick: This pool area is sacred right now.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Iris: Probably for the best.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:17 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm starting to get really annoyed here.

_Emmett slammed his fist into the small table next to him._

8ball Does Garrick take something out of his pocket to try and alleviate Emmett?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:19 PM)_
Nien.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:19 PM)_

_Vargas contemplates all his lost. And slums into darkness._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:19 PM)_
8ball Does Garrick take something out of his pocket to try and alleviate Emmett?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:19 PM)_
Bro, your action made it. Welcome to the party. (Yes).

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:19 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, I don't know what's happening to me.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:19 PM)_

> Emmett: But I'm feeling really pissy.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:19 PM)_

_Garrick tosses an unknown green condiment to Emmett._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:19 PM)_

> Sanya: What's your grass level at?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:20 PM)_

> Garrick: Grass smoothie.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:20 PM)_

> Garrick: Or something.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:20 PM)_

_Iris' eyes return to normal as she heads to the kitchen._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:20 PM)_

_Emmett takes the condiment, eats it, and spits it out. His mouth was on fire._

> Emmett: Garrick, I'm gonna kill you!

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Garrick: Whoa, chill out! I didn't know!

**Sean** _(26-May-20 05:21 PM)_
8ball Does everyone playing minecraft Die?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:21 PM)_
Spanish no.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:21 PM)_

_Iris makes it to the kitchen._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:21 PM)_

_Emmett took out his Maggo-Pistol and changed its setting to "Spectral"._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett!

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Sanya: Put it down.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:21 PM)_

> Emmett: Fuck off.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:22 PM)_

> Vargas: Vargas jumps into the pool and stays under for a couple of minutes.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:22 PM)_

_Garrick pulls out a Worn Spear._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:22 PM)_

> Garrick: We don't have to do this, dude.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:22 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett, do not make a decision you'll regret.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 05:22 PM)_

> Dakari: Keep it down out there!

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:22 PM)_

_Emmett was twitching a bit._

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 05:22 PM)_

_Under his voice_

> Dakari: Always so much noise.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:22 PM)_

_D: I have an idea, but he might not like it._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:22 PM)_

> Emmett: I just want to keep things peaceful, but you and your antics have got to go.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:23 PM)_

_Vargas pulls out his two laser blades while hopping out the water_

> Vargas: Calm down Emmet. Calm down.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Your fault for drinking some random green sludge.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:23 PM)_

> Emmett: You tried to prank me with Iris, you took her away from me, and then you prank me again.

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:23 PM)_
🤔 | Jelsafan0, I pick croissants

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:23 PM)_

> Emmett: I THOUGHT IT WAS GRASS!

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, that's your problem!

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:23 PM)_

_Iris starts to bake croissants._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:24 PM)_

_Sanya grabs Emmett's arm._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:24 PM)_

> Sanya: Do not do this.

**Rashidi** _(26-May-20 05:24 PM)_
8ball Does Dakari go and explore the rest of the ship?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:24 PM)_
It is certain.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:24 PM)_

_Emmett backs up from the pool to the edge of the ship. Afterwards, he was grabbed._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:24 PM)_

_Iris is baking croissants._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:24 PM)_

> Emmett: I just really want to be listened to.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:25 PM)_
It says indicisive.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:25 PM)_

_Garrick pockets the spear._

**Michael** _(26-May-20 05:25 PM)_
8ball does Vargas pass out?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:25 PM)_
Person who's after you decides!

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_
Yes

> Emmett: I'm unstable, aren't I?

**Michael** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

_knocks on the Vortox's Pummelers ship door_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Not as unstable as he is.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Theylin: Hello?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Fucking clown.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Garrick: Yeah, man. This isn't what I meant when I said to 'take initiative'.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

_Vargas wakes up._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

_Emmett leans back off the railing._

**Silas** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_
8ball does Vargas feel himself slowly transforming into a marble?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_
N0.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Garrick: You feeling alright?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: No.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

_Croissants._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: I feel empty.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Filled with angry spirits.

**Charles** _(26-May-20 05:27 PM)_
_Vargas gets kidnapped. _

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:27 PM)_

> Emmett: Filled with lust and envy and wrath.

**Cooldude** _(26-May-20 05:27 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett pee in the pool?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:27 PM)_
Sad to tell you that it does not happen.

**Michael** _(26-May-20 05:27 PM)_

> Theylin: Hello?!

_continues knocking on the door of Seth's ship_

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:27 PM)_
8ball Do I zip up Vargas' hands?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:27 PM)_
Very doubtful.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Emmett: I need grass.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Emmett: I need grass bad.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Garrick: Sanya, you got any?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Emmett: How often do you chase that high?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:28 PM)_

> Sanya: I might.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:28 PM)_

_Iris is just still baking croissants._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett: What high?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett: This feels terrible!

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:29 PM)_

> Garrick: Is this grass stuff healthy for you?

**Michael** _(26-May-20 05:29 PM)_

_bangs on Seth's ship door_

> Theylin: I know y'all are in there

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:29 PM)_

> Garrick: It's having very adverse effects.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett: That's called a withdrawal where I'm from.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_

_Sanya pulls out Garrick's true identity, then puts it back._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_

_Emmett slid down and held his legs to himself._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_
8ball has Iris baked 1000 croissants?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_
You got it.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't know...?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_

_Garrick is imbued with immense fear while the index card is exposed._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_

_He decides to look again..._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_

> Emmett: I've had grass for like, my entire life!

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:30 PM)_

_Sanya glares deep at Garrick, then sits with Emmett._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:31 PM)_

> Emmett: I feel like everyone is staring at me.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:31 PM)_

> Sanya: Because we care.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:31 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm always being stared at.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:31 PM)_

_Iris has baked 1000 croissants and feels a little bit better. She keeps making croissants, though._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:31 PM)_

> Emmett: But the whole galaxy's eyes are on me.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:31 PM)_

> Sanya: Hey, you did end up taking my advice. You wanted people to care, so you made us care.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_
8ball Does Squoat chime in?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_
Yo mama. (Yes).

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_

> Garrick: Well, in all fairness, you are the most wanted man right now.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_

> Sanya: The life you live will be and always has been a dangerous one.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_

_To Emmett, this was a loud ass voice. To everyone else, some buzzing was coming from his ears._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_

> Emmett: "SQUEMFET."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_

> Emmett: What?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:32 PM)_

> Emmett: Who's there?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:33 PM)_

_D: He is here. Leave the Squoat be._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:33 PM)_

> Emmett: "IT'S ME. SQUOAT."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:33 PM)_

> Emmett: What? How are you speaking to me?

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:34 PM)_
Signs point to yes.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:35 PM)_

> Emmett: "I can speak to every Squoatling."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:35 PM)_

> Emmett: "I'm god-I mean, I'm Squoat, remember?"

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:35 PM)_

> Garrick: What's wrong, Dread?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: It's been a while since I've seen you.
> Emmett: Is he alright?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

_Iris is baking croissants._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: "Nevermind that. I need to tell you something."

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

_His god is talking to him._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: What?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Garrick: Oh. Good timing.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

_We should let them commune in peace._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: "I've been on the run."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: On the run? What does that even mean? You're Squoat!

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: "Squoat's gotten himself into some trouble."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

_Emmett was having a revelation in his mind about now._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: "I've gotten to a safespace to talk with you."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: It took you...

_Emmett counts on his digits._

> Emmett: "Thirteen GUYs. I know."

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:38 PM)_

_When a god communes with an individual, it's normally a big deal. Maybe not for others, but if, say, Sanya met with a group of Florans, she would be treated as a messiah._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:39 PM)_

> Emmett: "Just let me continue. I need you to get off the grass."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:39 PM)_

> Emmett: Why?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:39 PM)_

> Garrick: Interesting.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:39 PM)_

> Garrick: He certainly looks entranced.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "It's terrible for you! Your family got you high on that stuff."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "The only reason the Tawfeeks were rich was because of their mass production of grass."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "Your parents left you alone a lot to make deals, my son."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "You were played."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "I know you need grass to live, Emmett. You have fetal grass syndrome or whatever."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "But you really need to cut down on it. A lot."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "You're going to kill yourself."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: Uhm.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: Okay.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: But I don't know how to stop.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: "Find a way. I'll tell you a way to find her if you do so."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: Who?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:46 PM)_
8ball has Iris made a huge model ship out of croissants in the kitchen

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:46 PM)_
It is decidedly so.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:46 PM)_

> Emmett: "Oh, you know. Yo Mama."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:46 PM)_

> Emmett: Who's that?

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:46 PM)_

> Emmett: "It was a joke."

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:46 PM)_

> Emmett: "I'll help you find Squ-"

_Squoat cut off._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:46 PM)_

> Emmett: What? What? What the fuck?

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:49 PM)_

_Hm. It seems like he's gone._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:49 PM)_

_Iris critically examines the model ship of croissants._

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:49 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett? Are you alright?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:49 PM)_

> Garrick: What'd he say? Emmett looks pissed off...

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:49 PM)_

> Garrick: Again.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:49 PM)_
8ball Does Iris run out into the pool suddenly in clothing made of croissants and dive?
(edited)

**FFBot** _(26-May-20 05:49 PM)_
Yes, definitely.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:50 PM)_

_Emmett stood up._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:50 PM)_

> Emmett: Squoat called.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:50 PM)_

> Garrick: Welcome to the party... really good timing, actually.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:50 PM)_

_Communications between gods and mortals should be contained between them. In fact, it's strange that you can even hear me, ghost._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:50 PM)_

> Garrick: Fair enough.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Emmett: I have a weird feeling about what just happened.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Iris: I baked over 2000 croissants.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Emmett: Like, Squoat didn't seem.... Sacred?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Garrick: It seems I have a lot of abilities I'm not aware of.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Iris: I feel better now.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Emmett: Does that make sense?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Iris: Yeah it does.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:51 PM)_

> Sanya: Iris. Where are your normal clothes and why are you wearing croissants?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

_Iris sighs._

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

> Garrick: I've heard it's like that with people you admire, Emmett.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

> Iris: I baked too many croissants.

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

> Garrick: It's disappointing 9 times out of 10.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

> Sanya: Here. Let me see if i can help.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

> Iris: The batter stuck to me and baked.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

_Emmett sneaked a peek at Iris for a second._

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:52 PM)_

> Emmett: But, guys.

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:53 PM)_

> Iris: My old clothes are underneath.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:53 PM)_

> Emmett: GARRICK! SANYA!

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:53 PM)_

> Emmett: LISTEN TO ME.

**Zander** _(26-May-20 05:53 PM)_

> Emmett: I need to get off of grass.

**Brody** _(26-May-20 05:53 PM)_

_Sanya turns back to Emmett, putting the weaponized Llama head back in Dread._

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:54 PM)_

> Iris: does anybody have a bread knife?

**Trey** _(26-May-20 05:54 PM)_

> Garrick: You get a revelation about that?

**Lili** _(26-May-20 05:54 PM)_

> Iris: Or clothes? Either?

It's been a week or so after the first episode. The crew has been pretty alright, for the most part, but Garrick and Sanya have been trying to keep Emmett out of trouble. That's all I can think of.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 03:58 PM)_

_Vargas wakes up._

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

_Emmett was somehow upset by even this little statement. He was also upset at the random intruder._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_

> Emmett: Problem is, this is our ship.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_

> Emmett: And I don't want a barracks.

_Emmett slammed his hoof down on the table._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

> Vargas: I meant my room not literal barracks.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

_Vargas laughed under his breath._

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Garrick: I really think you're missing out on the opportunity to sleep in the pool.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: Please don't test me.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm under a lot of physical stress right now.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Vargas: I'm sorry.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

_Garrick whispers to Vargas._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_

> Vargas: Yeah. I'll leave him alone.

_Vargas whispers to Garrick._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_

_Emmett sighed and opened one of the cabinets. He notices a batch of grass._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett reach for the grass?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_
Da.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_

> Garrick: no

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_

_Garrick whispers "No" into Emmett's ears._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

_Mateo stops eating the sourdough and stared at Emmett._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

> Emmett: No.
> Emmett: Dude! Reverb!

_Emmett tosses the grass in surprise._
8ball Does Mateo grab the grass and stick it in his pocket?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_
As I see it, yes.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Emmett: You made me drop it!
> Emmett: You're not having this.
> Emmett: Why?
> Emmett: I don't even know you!
> Emmett: Clearly, it's addictive.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Garrick: Whatever works.

_Garrick takes the grass from Mateo's pockets and puts them in HIS pockets._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

\*\*

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Emmett: I've seen too many good people lost to anything like this.

_Emmett didn't notice Garrick's stealing._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_
8ball does Vargas become a crew member for good?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_
You decide. You earned it!

> Garrick: Look like grass. Smell like grass.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Vargas: STOOOOP!!! Throw away the grass. NOW!

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Emmett: If you don't need it, why do you want it so badly?

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

_Garrick pockets Vargas._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Vargas: Give it to me.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Emmett: It just comforts me.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Emmett: Now please.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Emmett: Give it back.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

_Vargas slaps Garrick._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Vargas: You tried to rob me!

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

_Vargas ultimately fails, because slapping the wall does nothing_

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

_Vargas says muffled._

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Garrick: You can come out once you stop being annoying.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Garrick: Nothing personal, it happens with every stowaway.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm not sure if I should.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

_Vargas says full of guilt._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

_Emmett was clearly overreacting._

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Garrick: Squoat also said you should get off of it.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

_Garrick pulls out a stick of Shock Chewing Gum and hands it to Emmett._

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_
8ball Does Seth hand Emmett a grass blunt?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_
NOOOOOO!

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_

_A piercingly loud screech could be heard from his head._

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

_Emmett's ears were popping. He took the shock gum and bit into the wrapper hard._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

> Garrick: Wait! I just realized what that was!

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Vargas: Can I get some comms now?

**Sean** _(01-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Seth: No.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

_Emmett shook from the combined efforts of the shock and the loud ass speaker in his head. He tried to cover his ears._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Vargas: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

_Vargas laughs watching from the side_

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 05:44 PM)_

_Emmett turned off the support in the airlock room. The lights went off and the room Vargas was in was slowly decompressing._

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 05:44 PM)_

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 05:47 PM)_

**Preston** _(01-Jun-20 05:51 PM)_

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 05:52 PM)_

_Vargas sees his friend pull up with a ship 5 times the size of Seths._

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 05:52 PM)_

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 05:53 PM)_
8ball Does the warship actually hit their ship?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 05:53 PM)_
Choose someone who decides for me.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 05:53 PM)_

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 05:53 PM)_

> Emmett: "We don't have enough time."

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 05:54 PM)_

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 05:57 PM)_
8ball Is Vargas just delusional from the coma he was in?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 05:57 PM)_
Sí.

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 05:57 PM)_

_Garrick returns from sleep-watching, hearing the commotion._

**Preston** _(01-Jun-20 05:57 PM)_
8ball Does Volentina get an extra set of her clothes that fit properly?

**FFBot** _(01-Jun-20 05:57 PM)_

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 05:58 PM)_

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 05:58 PM)_

> Garrick: So, uh, Emmett. Did you get rid of the ball guy yet?

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 05:58 PM)_

_Emmett bangs on the prison cell door to shut Vargas up._

**Preston** _(01-Jun-20 05:58 PM)_

> Volentina: Am I? I'm pretty sure I'm Volentina, not a lot taller

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 05:59 PM)_

> Vargas: Wrong universe.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 05:59 PM)_

> Emmett: Vargas has been unconscious this whole time.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 05:59 PM)_

> Emmett: He's been fucking screaming in his sleep.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 05:59 PM)_

> Emmett: He's been annoying.

**Preston** _(01-Jun-20 05:59 PM)_

> Volentina: What the hell is a Vargas?

**Trey** _(01-Jun-20 05:59 PM)_

> Garrick: Sounds like a good reason to airlock him, if you ask me?

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 05:59 PM)_

> Emmett: No.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 05:59 PM)_

> Emmett: Anyhow.

**Charles** _(01-Jun-20 06:00 PM)_
Vargas is dreaming that he became a empire of a universe using his magic 8ball that leads him to justice

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 06:00 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm going to play with my rod. That'll get me away from touching grass.

**Zander** _(01-Jun-20 06:00 PM)_

_Emmett looks towards the fourth wall, shrugs his arms, and winks._

_Emmett rotates in his swivel chair, away from his holodevice._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:26 PM)_

_Sanya finally woke up from her 72-hour nap in a flower pot._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:26 PM)_

> Vargas: Hello? Anyone there?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:26 PM)_

> Sanya: So, what's the rest of the plan?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:27 PM)_

_"I needed my beauty sleep", she said._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:27 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't know. I just know that I need a suit fast.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:27 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:28 PM)_

_Emmett ignored the screaming man._

> Emmett: We're getting more Ducketts from this. Roughly 75,000 more.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:28 PM)_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:28 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:29 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:29 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't know. I'm just having a quaint dinner with a Llamanian.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:29 PM)_

> Volentina: And what happens if it goes really south really fast?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:30 PM)_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:30 PM)_

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:30 PM)_
8ball did Emmett tell Sanya and Garrick about his Llamanian encounter?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 03:30 PM)_
Yes, but in a monotonous tone.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:31 PM)_

_Garrick emerges from the wall._

> Garrick: I feel like you've had enough Llamanian encounters recently.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:31 PM)_

> Sanya: Do you honestly think this is a good idea? After what happened?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:31 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm fine. I enjoy the threats.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:31 PM)_

_Garrick also slaps Emmett on the back like a dad._

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:31 PM)_

> Volentina: You... enjoy the threats?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:31 PM)_

_Emmett feels his back._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:32 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:32 PM)_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:33 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:34 PM)_

_Emmett counted on his digits._

> Emmett: 5 Llamanians.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:34 PM)_

> Garrick: Danger is fun, I understand, but you're putting yourself in a LOT of it.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:34 PM)_

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:35 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:35 PM)_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett have a secret stash of grass?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_
Yes but actually no.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_

> Emmett: Try what?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)_

> Seth: For Sethman is here with his superdong

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)_

> Garrick: By the way, Seth.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)_

> Garrick: I found the Ottori girl you rescued a few GUYs ago.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)_

_D: I hate this place._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)_

> Garrick: She's alive, somehow.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)_

_Seth shakes his dong around flinging vaginal fluids and cum all over the place_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm going to tend to the prisoner.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)_

> Sanya: Garrick, come here.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)_

_Emmett shielded his eyes and proceeded to leave to the brig._

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)_

> Seth: Thats cool, what about her?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)_

_Sanya turns off her comms._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Vargas: Can someone let me out so i can wash my shit covered ass and get a change of clothes please?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Garrick: She needs a room.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Emmett: Dude.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Seth: Why?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Garrick: Me and Chomsky only have 2 beds.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Emmett: There's a toilet literally right next to you.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Seth: Get another bed then.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Seth: Heres some money

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Vargas: this happened when i passed out and died for a second.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

_Emmett fingered the numpad for a bit, unlocking the cell door._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Garrick: Alright, I'll just assign her a room myself, then.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Garrick: What's up, Sanya?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)_

> Emmett: Can you behave, please?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)_

> Vargas: Thanks.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)_

> Emmett: We have no prostacian or whatever it is.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)_

> Vargas: As long as my plostacian is ok.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)_

_Seth digs in his urethra and takes out 300 ducketts, he throws them at Garrick_

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)_

> Seth: Now go buy a bed.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)_

_Sanya starts to whisper_

> Sanya: Garrick, we need to make sure Emmett doesn't go in there.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)_

> Garrick: Gross. Here you go, Sanya.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)_

> Emmett: Where's your "plostacian"?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)_

> Emmett: I never heard of it.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)_

_Garrick tosses the urethra Ducketts to Sanya._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)_

_Vargas sees this as he walks out of the brig_

> Vargas: What the fuck!

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)_

> Garrick: Emmett, do you have another bed?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

> Sanya: Gross.

_She throws them behind her._

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

_Seth turns beet red and begins erupting smoke out of his pores because he is so mad_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

> Emmett: What's wrong, 8ball man?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

> Vargas: Nothing.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

> Sanya: Garrick, I have an idea.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

> Vargas: Its with the stuff you took.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

> Garrick: SQUEMFET

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

> Emmett: I didn't take anything. Maybe Seth did.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

_Seth's head turns into a volcano and starts erupting as Seth starts to uncontrollably scream_

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_

> Vargas: Take a ounce of it. Its good shit man.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_

> Emmett: GARRICK, HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_
8ball Does Volentina have a functioning Gameboy?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_
Nope.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_

> Vargas: SEEEEEEEEEEETH.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_

> Seth: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_

> Sanya: Why is everyone screaming?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_
8ball does emmet really ave my stuff

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_
No.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_

> Emmett: What the hell is going on?!

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_

> Garrick: I'VE KNOWN YOUR NAME FOR 4 GUYS. ANYWAYS CAN THE OTTORI ROOM WITH YOU AND DAKARI?!?!

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_

> Vargas: Give me my plostacian.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_

> Garrick: Yes. Sanya. What is your plan.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_
Volentina wandered out of the brig, namely away from the noise.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_

> Vargas: Seth.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_

> Sanya: Listen, turn off your comms.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_

_Emmett muttered._

> Emmett: oh yeah, technically i did tell you that.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_

> Emmett: I have a bed. There's an Ottori?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_

> Sanya: I have an idea. Emmett's currently not in his right mind.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)_

> Seth: FORTNITE FORTNITE FORTNITE

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)_

> Garrick: Yeah, Seth rescued her and she got stuck in my pockets.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)_

> Vargas: PLOSTACIAN WILL CLEAR THAT RIGHT UP!

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)_

> Emmett: I see.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)_

> Vargas: Luckily i have some in my secret shirt pocket.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)_

> Emmett: You want me to make some space?

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

_Seth takes out a small wood pipe and puts on an old fashioned suit and tie_

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

> Garrick: Yeah, we don't have any space in our room.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

> Garrick: You could double up, Sanya.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

_Emmett tried to cover his ears from the screaming 8ball head._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

> Sanya: Actually, i may have an idea

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

> Vargas: Yes please.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

> Garrick: I'll be right back.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

_He then takes out a library with a fireplace and an armchair_

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

_Vargas takes a quick sniff._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

_Garrick leaves to tell Jess of her room reassignment._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

> Vargas: Thats some good shit right there.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

_Seth pulls a book from the bookcase and then sits down, lighting his pipe_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

> Sanya: If Garrick won't help, i may have to do this myself.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

> Emmett: You think she has any skills for the crew?

_Emmett walked over to the crew quarters block._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

> Vargas: Its better than grass Emmet. I promise.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_
emet

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

> Emmett: Garrick?

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

> Seth: Chapter One, Why I hate Mathias

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

> Emmett: You turn your coms off?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

> Garrick: No, I can hear you.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

_Sanya followed Emmett, walking with him._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

> Emmett: Matthias was kind-of a douche, yeah.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

> Garrick: She might. She had to survive in my pockets.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

_Vargas follows Emmet._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

> Vargas: Where are the showers.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

_Garrick follows Emmett._

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

> Volentina: Huh.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Vargas: By the way my name is Vargas.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Emmett: Front of the ship and next to the quarters.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

_Jessica follows Garrick._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Garrick: Here's your roommate.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

_Emmett turns around, seeing the apparent conga line._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Vargas: Thank you also who are you two.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Emmett: Uh... Oh hi!

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Sanya: I swear.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Seth: Reason one, Matthias feigns superiority even though he is a bird that is unable to fly

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Garrick: "Hey."

_She barely recognizes him._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

_Emmett stiffened his back and put his hoof on the back of his horns._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

> Garrick: Also, she needs clothes... HEY, SANYA

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

> Emmett: Jeez, it's been a long time.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll check.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

> Vargas: So who are you Two?

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

> Seth: Reason 2

_Seth takes a puff of his pipe_

> Seth: I hate birds

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

> Garrick: Oh, you're right there.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

_Seth blows smoke into the comms, causing smoke to emit from everyone's comms_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)_

_Emmett turns down his comms and tries to have a conversation with the Ottori. He waved away the smoke promptly._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)_

> Emmett: Let's introduce ourselves again.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)_

> Seth: Reason 3, He is an asshole.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm Squemfet Tawfeek, but you can just call me Emmett.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)_
(Sean, Isn't Matthias in your fanny pack)

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)_

_Matthias is angrily cawking from Seth's satchel._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)_
Who is in my pockets

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)_
Yes

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)_

> Seth: Chapter 2, My relationship with Goddess of Lust

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, if it's an issue, I have clothing for her.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)_

> Garrick: "I'm Jessica. Jess is fine."

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)_

> Vargas: Oh never mind its just plostacian.

_Vargas takes a quick bump._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)_

> Sanya: Alright.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)_

> Emmett: Follow me, Jess.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)_

> Seth: There once was a fine young lady with a big busom and even bigger tush, I fancied her quite a bit back in my younger years. Every boy in town wanted a go at her, just to know how a romp with her would feel

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)_

_Sanya reaches up her hand to her flower, to receive an old kimono_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)_

> Sanya: Here.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)_

> Garrick: "Okay."

_She hesitantly follows._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)_
Ima wash up see you Sanya? and Garrick?

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)_

> Volentina: Better.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)_

_Emmett went into his room and opened the closet, making no mind to the sleeping Dakari. In it was a large variety of burgundy red elven shirts with various warm highlights._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)_

> Emmett: I know I don't have very much variety.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)_

> Sanya: Jesus.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

> Vargas: OK.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

_Sanya walks over to Emmetts room._

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

> Seth: This isn't about her. Instead, this is about an immortal goddess with perky tits, a flat stomach, and a bouncy ass, the very same one who is the reason for my curse

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth, what are you doing?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

> Sanya: Here, something that would fit better.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

> Seth: Reading my dear son.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

> Garrick: "Huh? Oh, thank you... grass lady."

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

> Vargas: Vargas washes up and puts on clean clothes.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

> Emmett: You wrote this?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

_Sanya throws the kimono in the room_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

> Sanya: The name is Sanya.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

_Emmett shrugged._

> Emmett: Thought they have nothing.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

> Seth: Indeed I did.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

> Vargas: Hello everyone.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

_Emmett hopped back onto his bed and leaned against the wall._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

> Vargas: I'm Vargas.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_
8ball Is the ship there?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_
You decide. You earned it!

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

> Sanya: Garrick, come here.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

> Seth: I spent a very long treacherous nights writing this out

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

_Garrick comes._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

> Garrick: Garrick comes.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Sanya: Do you know how to hardlock a door?

_She whispers_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Emmett: "THE RESTAURANT, LLAMANIAN UNDERGROUND, HAS ALMOST BEEN REACHED."

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Vargas: Sooooo Seth, want some drugs?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

_The ottori also puts on actual clothes._

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Seth: GARRICK, NO CUMMING

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

_Emmett shielded his eyes, respecting her privacy._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Sanya: We need to keep Emmett in here.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Seth: Im sorry what was that?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Vargas: WHAT THE FUCK!!!!

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Emmett: We're almost there.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Garrick: I could probably figure it out.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:02 PM)_
Ill be the decoy

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:02 PM)_

> Emmett: Any of you have a suit for me?

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:02 PM)_

> Seth: Im a little hard of hearing

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:02 PM)_

> Vargas: Ill be the decoy.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:02 PM)_

> Sanya: Good. try to do that.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:02 PM)_

_Seth takes out a big horn and puts it in his ear_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:02 PM)_
8ball Can Garrick hardlock the door?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:02 PM)_
Majority rules! Vote on it!

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

> Vargas: For some plostacian of course. I just need one ounce.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

_Emmett's jaw drops to the floor, his eyes extend at a velocity never before seen, he takes out a boxing glove and hits himself with it 17 times, pants like a dog, and yells AOOOOGA AOOOOGA then turns to the audience and says in 1930's New York accent "HOT MAMA, now that's a dame!"_

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

> Seth: We dont do drugs on this ship

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

> Emmett: Vargas. Please shut up.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

> Seth: We are drug free

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

> Emmett: What are you talking about, Seth?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

> Emmett: You're constantly taking drugs.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

> Vargas: Yeah Seth?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

> Emmett: You just don't want me to have my race's drugs.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

_Seth turns his head 360 degrees and extends his neck out to Emmett's face_

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

> Vargas: Vargas traps Emmet in the ship and headsout as the decoy.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

_Garrick sneaks over and shuts the room door while Emmett is AWOOGAing at Jess._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

_Emmett's arms shook a bit from withdrawals._

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

> Seth: Repeat that again sonny?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)_

> Sanya: Garrick, if you can, i need you to lock him in his room. We can't let him go out there.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm turning off video comms.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)_

> Emmett: You're fucking creepy.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)_

> Seth: In the horn please?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)_
8ball does Vargas trap emmet on the ship and becomes the decoy

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)_
Person who's after you decides!

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)_
Volentina just begins wandering around.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)_

> Emmett: YOU DON'T WANT ME TO HAVE GRASS. YOU'RE A HYPOCRITE. YOU'RE ALWAYS SMOKING SPACE WEED.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)_
Preston decide.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:06 PM)_
8ball does Garrick lock Emmett in

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:06 PM)_
Yes, but with a caveat decided by the person before you.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:06 PM)_

_Emmett looks at the Ottori and frowns a little._

> Emmett: Sorry for my language.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:06 PM)_

> Seth: shut up boy!

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:06 PM)_

> Seth: YOU SHAN'T SPEAK TO YOUR DADDY THAT WAY

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_

> Vargas: Hey Emmet behave and ill give you some grass.

_Whispers Vargas._

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_

_Seth draws his belt from his pants and starts hunting for Emmett_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_

_Emmett turns off his video comms._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_

> Garrick: "Yeah, it's a little weird-"

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_

_The lights go out in his room._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_

> Sanya: Nice job. C'mon, we've got a diner to infiltrate.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_

> Emmett: Uh...

_Emmett went to the light switch and flickered it a few times._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_

> Emmett: Lights are dead.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_
8ball Is the ship there?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:08 PM)_
Y35.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:08 PM)_

_Seth arrives at Emmett's room_

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:08 PM)_

> Garrick: Nice teamwork. Hope they get along in the dark.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:08 PM)_

> Seth: GET OUT HER BOY

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:08 PM)_

_Emmett tries to open his hatch, getting no movement_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:08 PM)_
Sean, Emmett's room is hardlocked.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:08 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth, can you hear me?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:08 PM)_
He can't leave

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:08 PM)_

> Seth: YOU'RE GONNA GET THIS BEATING

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:14 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:15 PM)_

_Emmett tried to make his way to his bed, bumping into pretty much everything._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:15 PM)_

_Jess falls asleep on Emmett's bed._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:15 PM)_

> Vargas: Hey wait a minute.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:16 PM)_

_Seth grabs the drugs Vargas is offering and throws it into the airlock. He then presses the button and jettisons it out into space_

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:16 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:16 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett trip onto Jess?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:16 PM)_
Yes, but in a monotonous tone.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:16 PM)_

_Vargas says under his breath._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:16 PM)_

> Emmett: Shit, shit! Sorry!

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:17 PM)_

_Emmett scoots to the side she wasn't on, pushing himself to the wall._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:18 PM)_

_Jessica is still asleep_

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 04:18 PM)_

> Volentina: Where exactly are we going?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:18 PM)_

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:18 PM)_
She's slept on hard spring mattresses for 4 GUYs

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:18 PM)_

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:18 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:19 PM)_

_Emmett sighs and gets under his covers._

> Emmett: If you're awake, you might want to get under the blanket. It gets ridiculously cold in here.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:19 PM)_

_Sanya grabs the robot and starts dragging him._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:19 PM)_

> Sanya: Come. On.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:19 PM)_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:20 PM)_

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 04:20 PM)_
Volentina slowly follows behind.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:20 PM)_

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:20 PM)_

_Seth keeps banging on the door_

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_

_is currently walking around the ship and sees Seth banging on Emmett's door_

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_
Its Seth banging on Emmetts door

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth, give it a rest man.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_

> Emmett: The others just hate me.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

> Sanya: Garrick, do you have any disguises?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

_Garrick, Sanya, and Vargas leave the ship._

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

> Theylin: What's happening guys? where is everyone?

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

> Seth: I will beat you lifeless boy!

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

> Garrick: I have some different clothing.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

> Sanya: And we're doing this for your own good, Emmett.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth, mellow out man.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

> Emmett: Actually, wait.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

> Vargas: Yeah, were sorry but its for the best.

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

> Theylin: What's happening guys?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

_Garrick pulls out a Marshmallow_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

> Sanya: We're planning an assassination.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: If you can grab me my grass from the top cabinet in the kitchen and bring it to me in one piece, I'll open the door for you.

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Theylin: That's totally kosher guys

_winks towards the camera_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: Then you can tear me a new ass or whatever.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Seth: Cali, open up the door.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

_Garrick pulled out the Illegal Marshmallow._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Sanya: Do not give him any grass.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Sanya: I-

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Theylin: I could just pick the lock...

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_
8ball Does Cali open the door?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_
No.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

_Vargas burns the grass._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

_D: No. NO. NOOOOO!_

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_

_He puts it back in fear and desperation._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_

> Emmett: "No, Seth."

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_

> Sanya: Give it back.

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_
8ball does Theylin turn into a puddle and go into Emmett's room?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_
No but actually yes.

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_

> Theylin: Emmett, I'm in your rooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_

> Seth: "I'm afraid I can't do that Captain."

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_

> Emmett: "The crew unanimously believes that this door should not open."

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_
I just lost the game.

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_
I just lost the game.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_

_Emmett didn't hear Theylin, and instead puts his arms around the Ottori for warmth._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_

> Emmett: Hope you don't mind this.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_

> Sanya: Alright, robot. Go in there and see if you can find our target.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_
Gtg real quick

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

> Emmett: I think Seth tampered with the air conditioning.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

> Sanya: When you've found him, lead him back outside.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

> Volentina: If he actually does manage to find the target, what then? Do we trap it or do we have weapons to attack?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

_Emmett looks to the LED air conditioning unit._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

> Garrick: "I'm fine."

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

> Sanya: You're lucky. I'm a trained assassin.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Emmett: It's 4 Celsius!

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Garrick: Don't be an idiot, also.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Volentina: That works.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Sanya: When we get a good shot, they're as good as dead.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Emmett: That's ridiculous...

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Sanya: "Can I get money to buy more drugs?"

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_

> Vargas: Ok ima go in.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_

> Sanya: Wait, new plan

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_

_Emmett shivered._

> Emmett: You want to talk to pass the time?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_

> Garrick: If you can successfully complete this mission, we will buy you as many drugs as you want.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_

> Garrick: I hope you overdose.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_

> Garrick: Whoops, I didn't mean to say that out loud.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_

> Sanya: See if you can slip some of your drugs in the clients' food.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_

> Vargas: Fuck you Garrick.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll stab him in the bathroom.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_

> Emmett: The crew doesn't want me out because I'm a high value target.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Vargas: Ill give im 20 ouncs of plostacian. Thatll kill himdead

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Sanya: No. Just give him enough to get him sick.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_
Richard Jamerez

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Vargas: 5 ounces is the safe at most. 7ounces ok

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Garrick: If he dies in the restaurant, it'll be suspicious.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't really know why the galaxy is against me.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Sanya: We don't want him dead in the middle of the restaurant. Exactly

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Sanya: It's better if someone else finds him dead.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Emmett: I didn't do anything wrong.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_
Yeah but it takes a few minutes for it to get through the system

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

> Garrick: "Who's after you?"

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

_Emmett takes off his watch and sticks it on the bedside table._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

> Emmett: Everyone, really.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

> Emmett: Even Vargas, I think. The stupid 8ball guy.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't really do much to protect myself though.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_
"I'm after you!" Romantic music starts playing, the lighting becomes sepia, their eyes become hearts

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:33 PM)_
8ball is EmmettFlower canon?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:33 PM)_
I guess not.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:33 PM)_

> Vargas: he'll be on his ship on gone before he dies

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:33 PM)_

> Vargas: come on 20 ounces

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:33 PM)_

_stops being puddle_

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_
8ball is there heavy romantic subtext between them

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_
Yes, but with a caveat decided by the next person.

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

> Theylin: ZZZZZZZZZZZaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnndddddddddeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrr

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

> Sanya: No. We need someone to discover the body.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

> Sanya: That's how assassination works.

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

> Theylin: yea

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

> Sanya: The more public location, the better.

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

> Theylin: Sanya, what's my job?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

> Vargas: I can set it up to look like he was doing a line.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

> Volentina: You could put enough in to poison the target, but not enough to kill him near instantly.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Sanya: Just listen to me. Get the job done.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Vargas: Exactly.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

_Emmett pushed his cheek into her fur._

> Emmett: Yeesh, you're warm.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Sanya: This is how it will go.

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_
8ball does Sanya become a puddle?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_
Majority rules! Vote on it!

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: But yeah.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

_Vargas ignores sonya._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: The whole galaxy is against me.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: And I have no freedom.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Garrick: "Our planet was pretty cold."

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Emmett: What about you?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Sanya: Robot, if you fuck this up, i will kill you myself.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Sanya: This plan will work, IF you follow the plan.

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Theylin: What do /i do?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_
We will ask my 8ball

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Garrick: "I've been kinda stuck in darkness for, like, 17 years. Life before all that was pretty nice, though."

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Emmett: You tried to marry Garrick, right?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Sanya: Just stay in the ship. Too many chefs in the kitchen ruins the dish.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_
8ball does vargas plan work

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_
Neigh.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_

> Garrick: "Yeah. There were two of him, though, so it was a little weird at first..."

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_

> Theylin: Tfw ur a glorified babysitter

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_

> Vargas: You know what youre awesome cool so ill listen.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_

> Emmett: He has commitment issues.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

_Vargas says in a happy tone._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

> Sanya: Fine, whatever works.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

> Garrick: "He's an interesting character..."

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_
8ball Is Richard seen entering the establishment?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_
Most Unlikely.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Vargas: Lets do both plans Sayna.

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_
8ball does Emmett conveniently become The HULK?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_
Bro, your action made it. Welcome to the party. (Yes).

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Sanya: No. Just listen to my plan.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Emmett: Awh, fuck.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Vargas: The line of coke thougggggh.

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Theylin: Bruh moment

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:41 PM)_

_Emmett lets go of Jess and his arms begin to bulken up._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:41 PM)_

> Emmett: Not again!

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:41 PM)_

> Sanya: Do not jeopardize the mission for your addiction.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:41 PM)_

> Emmett: I thought I stopped this!

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:41 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett?

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:41 PM)_

_watches Emmett hulk out_

> Emmett: "What's an elephant?"

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:04 PM)_

_Garrick sighs._

> Garrick: This whole Crave thing only exists because of your withdrawals. The fact that it's happening at least proves that it's working.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_

_Sanya notices the rustling, and slowly pulls out her knife._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_

> Emmett: "You think I'm retarded?"

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_

> Sanya: You wouldn't want to make a scene, would you?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_

_Emmett yawns._

None of her bones are broken or anything she just got the wind knocked out of her

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 05:10 PM)_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:10 PM)_

> Sanya: So do not test me.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:11 PM)_

> Emmett: "I bet you're hiding something valuable in that yacht of yours."

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:11 PM)_

_Garrick leaves the room._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:11 PM)_

> Sanya: Maybe. But I assure you, you won't get a chance to learn.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:11 PM)_

_The lights also went back on after Garrick unlocked the door._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:11 PM)_

_Emmett stares at the wreckage. He picks up his holodevice and kicks some desk rubble into the hallway._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:12 PM)_

_Richard stands up, and four more Llamanians come in front of him._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:12 PM)_

> Garrick: I'm just gonna go get something from the fridge...

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:12 PM)_

> Emmett: "Take care of the egotistical flower for me."

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:12 PM)_

> Sanya: Cocky. I like that. Makes the meat tastier when they try to fight back.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:13 PM)_

_Sanya Cuts down the first Llamanian easily._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_
No. In fact, the opposite happens.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

_Emmett gets to his watch and mutters into it._

> Emmett: Sorry man---er, woman. I need to make sure I didn't hurt someone. Good night.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

> Volentina: It's a bust, target has taken off and Sanya's surrounded

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:21 PM)_

You decide. You earned it!

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Garrick: Gross, they're not toes.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

8ball does Wemmfort suck on Garrick's "toes"?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_
Happy to tell you that it does happen.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_
That 8ball is retconned because having two gods is OP

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_

> Sanya: Um, Garrick? You have company.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

_Wemmfort tries to catch the wispy base in his mouth, but unfortunately fails, because he cannot touch them._

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll go see if I have some form of swimsuit.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

_Sanya walks back to her room._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

_Impatient, Emmett hops atop of Sanya, holding her head. He does so as Sanya enters her room._

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Toe yum.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Emmett: You're reaaaaaally slow.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:41 PM)_

_Emmett pokes her cheeks._

> Emmett: Get your clothing, you plant.

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:42 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Anyway, what's behind that mask of yours?

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:43 PM)_

> Sanya: I'm not changing with you in the room. There have already been enough of my naked body today.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:43 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, are you really that insecure about your nipple-less body?

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:43 PM)_

> Emmett: Or rather, insecure about me seeing it?

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:43 PM)_

> Emmett: You got completely nude while drunk once. I didn't care.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:44 PM)_

> Sanya: What? When was this?

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:45 PM)_

> Emmett: I dunno, like a few semesters ago.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:45 PM)_

_Garrick exits the living quarters in his 'swimsuit'._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:45 PM)_

> Emmett: On Vogega.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:46 PM)_

> Sanya: Whether I've been naked or not doesn't matter. Just get out my room, Emmett.

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:46 PM)_

_Wemmfort repeats what he said._

> Wemmfort: What's behind that mask of yours?

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:46 PM)_

> Garrick: My face.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_

_Sanya reaches to grab the Squoatling_

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_

> Garrick: My face is also in front of the mask.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_
8ball does Garrick take off his mask, revealing the horror of maskless Garrick to Wemmfort?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_
Spell it with me now, Y-E-S.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_

> Garrick: Just for you, pal.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:48 PM)_

_Like a sloth, Emmett hangs over her head, pushing his cheek against her flower._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:48 PM)_

> Emmett: Nah....

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:48 PM)_
It's the truth

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:48 PM)_
You can't hide from it

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:49 PM)_
8ball Does maskless Garrick look like Squarrick?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:49 PM)_
No.

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:49 PM)_
8ball is maskless Garrick Emmett 2?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:49 PM)_
Outlook bad.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:50 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya forcibly remove Emmett from her room?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)_
You don't got it.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)_
8ball does Emmett forcibly remove Sanya from her room?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)_
Yes, definitely.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)_

_Sanya is pushed out of her room, as the door thuds closed_

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett, what are you doing? Get out of there, I need to change.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:52 PM)_

> Emmett: Well, Sanya.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:52 PM)_

> Emmett: You see, I need to dress you up.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:52 PM)_

> Emmett: And you won't let me if I'm out of here.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:53 PM)_

> Sanya: I'm changing in your room, then.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:55 PM)_

> Emmett: Here.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:55 PM)_

_Emmett takes some clothes from Sanya's closet. They were pastel colored, potentially Mary's clothing._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:55 PM)_

> Emmett: Wear this.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

> Sanya: That's... not my swimsuit. Here, it's in the back of the closet.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

> Emmett: This is a swimsuit.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

> Emmett: Unless you have someone else's clothing in here.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

> Emmett: Kinda weird...

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:57 PM)_

_Sanya reaches past and grabs an outfit similar to her daily wear, but without sleeves._

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:57 PM)_

> Sanya: Those are... Iris'. She must have put them in my closet. I'll give them back to her.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:57 PM)_

_Sanya grabs the clothes from Emmett, stuffing them in her flower._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:58 PM)_

_Emmett crosses his arms._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:58 PM)_

> Emmett: Alright then.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:58 PM)_

_Emmett sat down on her bed, eyeing her._

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_

> Sanya: Now, are you going to leave while I change?

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_
8ball is chomsky black

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_
Outlook good.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_
@Jonas

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_
@Jonas

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_

_Emmett shrugged._

> Emmett: I need to change too.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_
8ball do they hurry up and change

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_
My reply is no.

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_
@Jonas

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

> Sanya: Just get out of my room.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

_Garrick turns into a naked molerat for three seconds._

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

> Garrick: WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING? HURRY UP

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

> Emmett: WOW. YOU REALLY WANT US TO HURRY UP?

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

> Garrick: ᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀ

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

_Emmett races out, tossing his shirt at Garrick._

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 05:03 PM)_

_Trey screams in final frontier_

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 05:03 PM)_

_Sanya locks the door behind Emmett, getting dressed._

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:03 PM)_

_Garrick catches the shirt and throws it back, starting a game of catch._

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 05:04 PM)_
Sanya's boobies look like this
(edited)

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

_Emmett catches the shirt and takes off his sweatpants. He tosses both back and puts on his trunks._

**Jonas** _(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_
Chomsky is not black

**Jonas** _(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_
Sorry to tell you trey

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_
White face

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_
Is he going on the beach trip with everyone else

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_
Chomsky is in fact, yellow
(edited)

**Jonas** _(16-Jun-20 05:06 PM)_
To be honest with you trey I'm not sure hes there at all
I only came in for 1 episode at the very beginning

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:06 PM)_
Is that why Garrick has a picture of his butt with sunglasses on it

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:06 PM)_
As memorabilia

**Jonas** _(16-Jun-20 05:06 PM)_
Sure

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_
He's stayed

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_
Just in the backlines until you one day pick him up

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_
And eat him

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_
And absorb

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_
8ball are Chomsky and Mary related

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_
No, but something that the person after you decides upon happens.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_
8ball says so

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_
8poop

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_
No, you are poop.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_
They're brother and sister
