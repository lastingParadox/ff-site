**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:09 PM)*
We stole a part of their ship with whatever was in it

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:09 PM)*
Emmett makes sure that that chunk is big enough to require an entire GUY's worth of fixing to replace

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:09 PM)*
So it is HUGE.

I'm reading and trying to learn how this 8ball works

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:15 PM)*
8ball Did the Llamanians almost capture Emmett during the experience?

**FFBot** *(21-Apr-20 12:15 PM)*
Signs point to yes.

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:15 PM)*
Very strange how they only scratched him. Hmm....

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:15 PM)*
8ball Before he left with the others, did the Llamanians grab a patch of his fur?

**FFBot** *(21-Apr-20 12:16 PM)*
Most likely.

**Rashidi** *(21-Apr-20 12:16 PM)*
Dakari is an amazing mercenary

**Rashidi** *(21-Apr-20 12:16 PM)*
No wonder you hired him

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:18 PM)*
@Brody#ff-media

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:18 PM)*
Unless you had other plans

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:18 PM)*
So currently there are five rooms to accommodate for the nine crew members that once were on the ship

**Brody** *(21-Apr-20 12:20 PM)*
I did have plans for Mary, she was really only going to be in short stories

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)*
Seth, with his own; Sanya, Emmett, Chomsky, Jim, Maia, Garrick, Iris, Hector, and Chase

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)*
Wait

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)*
That's ten

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)*
So after Maia and Chomsky left, that remained 8

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)*
I'm sure everyone would want to shift their rooms around due to the crew additions/leavings
(edited)

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)*
The chunk of ship from the Llamanians will be able to accommodate for 4 more rooms
(edited)

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:21 PM)*
Plus storage and potentially another engine.

**Brody** *(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)*
Yeah

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)*
But for the time being, who's sharing with who? (Before the new additions)

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)*
We'd have two free slots

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)*
Chase, Iris, and Jim left eventually

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)*
So that's 5

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)*
hector went back to Mars

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)*
So no one is sharing rooms currently

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)*
Four people

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)*
Seth, Sanya, Emmett, Garrick

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:23 PM)*
I'm sure Chomsky is coming back

Emmett, from his culture's perspective, is roughly 21, but from the GU's perspective, is 24.

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 12:30 PM)*
Let's move

**Zander** *(21-Apr-20 06:48 PM)*
@deleted-roleAfter Emmett was welcomed back into the crew, he was devastated. He had spent an entire GUY under the effects of believing that he had a Squoatling wife. He had completely forgotten and forgiven Seth for airlocking him; he wanted vengeance for the Llamanians giving him a dream and them crushing it. For roughly two GUYs, he researched and steadily made a plan to ransack the Llamanian mothership, wanting to make a message that he was not someone to mess with. He didn't want to kill them off either, as he believed that they were still people under the effects of an abusive rule as opposed to monsters. He and the crew hired hundreds of mercenaries to get them into the ship and raid, with many of them being hired to be cannon fodder.
Anyhow, the day before the current episode was the day of the raid. While Emmett planned on killing a few Llamanians and stealing some of their machinery, the crew somehow stole a chunk of the mothership that was almost the size of their own ship. The original crew left with little damage, aside from Seth breaking his leg. All that was left from the assault was a chunk of Emmett's fur, taken from the back of his neck.

The current episode was the aftermath of their celebration, when Emmett got pretty drunk and Seth took on an army of ladies. Currently, everyone is asleep, Chomsky, Iris, and Dakari are sleeping in the living block (main area/hangout room), and the holovision is on, but showing static.

The Anole and the Alternion are currently at a space station. The crew is pretty low on fuel and food, but should be able to make it to the spacestation, given they want to fly there. The weekly GU broadcast, which showcases important news and announcements, is meant to broadcast soon.

**Jonas** *(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)*
8ball did wes leave his oven on so his ship catches on fire

**FFBot** *(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)*
Without a doubt.

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)*
> Sanya: some PLANT!

**Jonas** *(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)*
> Chomsky: that sucks

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)*


*the croissant runs towards the storage room*

**Jonas** *(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)*
> Chomsky: guys uh, that ship...

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)*
> Emmett: Sanya, can you please not send your pheromones over to our friend here?

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)*
> Emmett: I don't think he wants to fornicate.

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)*
> Seth: Oh, Sanya!

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)*


*BOOOOOM*

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)*
> Seth: Thats your name

**Jonas** *(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)*
> Chomsky: hey newbie, that yours?

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)*
> Seth: I remember you.

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)*


*Noticing the explosion, Wes is devastated.*

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)*
> Wes: FUCK!

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)*
> Seth: Haha, ship go boomie

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)*


*Sanya takes this time to flip over the lizard and pin him to the ground*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)*


*Emmett holds his hoof out.*

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)*
> Garrick: Nowhere to run, TV guy.

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)*


*Wes kicks Sanya in the chest while sprinting towards his beloved ship*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)*
> Emmett: Want to be even mor-

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)*


*Iris follows the croissant.*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)*


*Emmett chases Wes intently*

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)*
> Sanya: Oh, you bitch.

**Jonas** *(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)*
> Chomsky: i know im the fire guy, but i swear i didnt light anything on fire this time.

*chomsky follows wes as well*

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)*


*Seth draws his laser rifle and sets it to stun as he follows the two*

**Jonas** *(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)*
> Chomsky: I KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH FIRES DONT WORRY

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)*
> Garrick: Don't stop it!

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)*


*the croissant enters through a slightly open door, making a startled squeak moments later*

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)*


*Sanya races after Wes*

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)*


*Iris dives in- she's a little attached to the croissant.*

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)*


*Arriving at the ship in shambles, Wes falls to his knees.*
> Wes: Oh, come on, that was my favorite raceship!

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)*


*it's pitch black inside*

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)*
8ball did the croissant fall off to reveal a duck?

**FFBot** *(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)*
Yes, definitely.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)*


*Emmett starts panting.*

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)*
> Iris: Duck!

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)*
> Emmett: I'm not in shape.

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)*


*with the only light being a singular green dot in the back corner and the small patch from the door*

**Jonas** *(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)*
> Chomsky: geez, what a burn. what happened to make it go up that suddenly?

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)*


*Sanya catches up and draws her word*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)*
> Emmett: I thought those were rats. Color me surprised.

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)*
> Sanya: Word

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)*
> Garrick: THATS RACIST

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)*


*the duck runs away hiding in the dark*

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)*


*Sanya then draws her sword*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)*
> Emmett: I was offering you a chance at redemption, Wes.
8ball Do I go towards the duck to pick it up?

**FFBot** *(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)*
The person who goes after you decides.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)*
> Emmett: I know your scandals.

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)*


*Iris hurries into the dark after the duckling.*
> Iris: Come back! Blueberry!

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)*
> Wes: It was custom made to move as fast as possible. The engine was almost completely exposed.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)*
> Emmett: Your steroids.

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)*
> Wes: My what now? I race ships, not people.

**Jonas** *(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)*
> Chomsky: dont you know how to build a ship?! the ENGINE was exposed?!

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)*
> Emmett: What's up with your jacked up arms?

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)*
> Wes: It was supposed to allow the vaccuum of space to cool it down!

**Rashidi** *(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)*
Yes

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)*
> Wes: The hell are you on about?

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)*
> Sanya: Skip the formalities and just kill him.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)*
> Emmett: Look at your fucking arms!

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)*
> Wes: Let a lizard grieve, man. This thing was like a son to me.

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*


*The door closes and locks behind the two*

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*
> Burner: Drop him

**Jonas** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*
> Chomsky: arent you rich? cant you buy a new identical ship?

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*


*Iris yelps, not liking that she can't see anything anymore.*

**Rashidi** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*
8ball Does Dakari search in his newly bought couch and find ducketts?

**FFBot** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*
No.

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*
> Wes: What do you mean!? My arms??

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*
> Emmett: Woah woah woah.

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*
8ball does Seth aim and stun Sanya, Emmett, and Wes?

**FFBot** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*
As I see it, yes.

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*
> Iris: Blueberry??

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*


*The fear gas is kicking in.*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*
> Emmett: Lets take it easy here. Who's talking?

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*
> Seth: Ah peace and quiet

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)*
> Sanya: Emmett, just shut up. Either recruit him or kill him.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)*


*Emmett has a small seizure*

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)*
> Sanya: I Sw-

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)*
> Seth: Alright Garrick, help me get them into the ship

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)*
> Garrick: Let's hold him for ransom. He's famous, isn't he?

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)*
> Garrick: Gotcha.

**Jonas** *(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)*
> Chomsky: hey i'd like a famous person in our crew. maybe he can do something about emmetts bounty.

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)*
> Wes: My...arms...?

*Wes watches as his arms begin melting in front of him. He is then knocked back into reality as he is stunned.*

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)*
> Burner: Diver you absolute shithead

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)*
> Burner: what were you thinking

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)*


*Seth starts dragging Wes, Emmett, and Sanya into the ship*

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)*
> Iris: I'm Iris, give me the duck.

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)*
> Seth: Emmett, stop squirming.

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)*
> Burner: Who are you.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)*
> Emmett: Clearly this is more intricate than you simply wanting the Duck.
8ball Does Emmett, once he's unstunned, buck the shit out of Seth, literally making a poop stain on the floor?

**FFBot** *(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)*
Group vote. Vote in the order from first player down to last. Majority opinion wins. No changing answers.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)*
> Emmett: I'm Mateo, and you?

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)*
8ball does Garrick successfully possess Wes

**FFBot** *(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)*
Most likely.

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)*
> Iris: Iris.

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)*


*Seth turns on his comms*

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)*
> Garrick: Good news, guys! He's weak, so I can get him on the ship!

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)*
> Emmett: I was asking the voice of which I cannot see its owner.

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)*
> Wes: Why am I moving

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)*


*Garrick-Wes walks shakily over to the ship.*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)*
> Emmett: Shhh.

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)*
> Garrick: Sorry, I haven't had legs in a while.

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)*
> Wes: What

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)*
> Seth: I need help, we got people we need to get on the ship, aka Emmett and Sanya.

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)*
> Burner: You're both going to stay quiet.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)*
> Emmett: We're getting put up for ransom.

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)*
> Wes: Why is there a voice inside my head

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Emmett: And why should I listen to your demands?

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Seth: Garrick, put him in the hold.

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*


*D: Hey Ghost, can you tell the Elf to stop dragging us so harshly?*

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Iris: Why?

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Garrick: I'm your conscience. You should go with them.

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Wes: ...

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Burner: Diver come here, we need to leave.

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Wes: I guess I was the instigator..

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Emmett: You still haven't made clear who you are.

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Garrick: Hey Seth... the flower says stop dragging them so harshly.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Emmett: Other than the fact that one of you is a duck.

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Seth: I'll try.

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*


*Garrick-Wes makes it to the ship.*

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Burner: And it's best that it stays that way

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Emmett: Yeah, sure.

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Iris: I'm not a duck.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*


*Emmett's tongue hangs out of his mouth and his mouth begins to foam a little.*

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)*
> Garrick: Seth! Grab him!

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*


*D: Tell him thank you.*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*
> Emmett: We both know how this ends if you try and sneak off.

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*
> Wes: Well, I guess I could use a ride, now that my ship is fucked.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*
> Emmett: I don't know this crew, but most seem rather batshit.

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*
> Garrick: Also, flower says thanks.

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*


*Seth starts kicking Emmett*

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*
> Seth: Stop squirming.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*
> Emmett: I think it's best you stick with me.

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*
> Burner: Is that so?

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*
> Iris: Wow- that's a little rude?

**Jonas** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*
> Chomsky: aight, you guys look like you have the...possessing handled. I'm headin back to my room

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*
> Emmett: I'm sorry, Cooking Mama.

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*
> Garrick: I can't hold on for very long, can someone grab this guy??

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*
> Wes: You guys have any beetles? I'm starving.

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)*


*Seth arrives at the ship and tosses the two into the ship*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)*
> Emmett: Allow me to extend my more serious apologies.

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)*
> Burner: I disagree. It's best the two of us leave and you two stay here for a minute.

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)*
> Wes: Wait, why is my conscience speaking about me in the third person?

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)*
> Seth: Alright, chums, lets get out of here.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)*
> Emmett: Well I am going to bring up a counterclaim.

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)*
> Garrick: Don't worry about it...

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)*
> Emmett: You'd rather a former GSS on your side than against you.

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)*
> Garrick: Oooooo....

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)*
> Emmett: Trust me.

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)*


*Low growling is heard from the corner with the small green light*

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)*


*Garrick splits from Wes and knocks him out.*

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)*
> Iris: I only bake when I'm stressed.

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)*


*D: Tell the lizard that i admire his fighting spirit.*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)*
> Emmett: Seth, you had the voltage way to high!

*Emmett's voice was almost incomprehensible.*

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)*
> Wes: Could you guys take me to my personal mechanic? I need to get a new S-

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)*
> Iris: Ookay, creepy noise- getting a little stressed now.

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)*
> Seth: What?

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)*
> Emmett: Your will is weak.

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)*
> Wes: I'm...ti..red..

**Jonas** *(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)*
not gay

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)*
> Iris: Yeah it is, what of it?

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)*


*Seth starts up the auto-pilot*

**Silas** *(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)*


*Wes collapses on one of the couches, taking up the whole thing.*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)*
> Emmett: That's the main difference between you and I.

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)*
> Seth: Alright, we're leaving.

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)*


*a quack responds from by the door*

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)*
> Seth: Hope you guys had everything.

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)*
> Iris: Blueberry!

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)*


*Iris heads towards the quack.*

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)*


*D: Well, this is interesting. I do want to try something, though...*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)*
> Emmett: I don't believe for a shred that's its name.

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)*
8ball is Emmett unstunned?

**FFBot** *(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)*
My sources say no.

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)*
> Garrick: Hey flower.

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)*
> Iris: Well what do you want me to do, ask the duck?

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)*
> Emmett: Yes.

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)*
8ball Does Dread possess Sanya's stunned body?

**FFBot** *(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)*
No.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)*
> Emmett: It talks.

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)*


*the growling continues*

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)*
> Seth: HEY, we're launching.

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)*
> Garrick: If I ate you, would I inherit dread fear power?

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)*
> Seth: Steel yourselves.

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)*
> Iris: Well how was I supposed to know that exactly?

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)*
> Burner: It's Diver his name is diver

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)*


*D: No.*

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)*
> Garrick: What if I stuck you in my pocket?

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)*
> Emmett: You've yet to tell me yours.

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)*
> Iris: Okay.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)*
> Emmett: I feel like we're on a First-Name basis by now.

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)*


*D: You'd have to put Sanya in your pocket, too.*

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)*


*Iris walks over, hoping to pick up Diver.*

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)*
> Burner: Mine doesn't matter, however diver seems to stay. what did you do?

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)*
> Emmett: Would you leave the duck the fuck alone?

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)*


*D: What if i ate you? What would that do?*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)*
> Emmett: I beg your pardon?

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)*
> Iris: Would you fuck off?

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)*
> Garrick: How would you manage that?

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)*


*Emmett finally stopped squirming.*

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)*
> Garrick: But hey, I can put Sanya in my pocket.

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)*
> Iris: I dunno, he just came out of a croissant I baked and he seemed to like me.

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)*


*The flower opens its eye-mouth*

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)*
> Seth: Oh good we can launch.

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)*


*D: Like this.*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)*
> Emmett: Can you not stun me?

*Emmett's voice was getting more understandable.*

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)*
> Garrick: Does that imply that you, in your physical form, can interact with spectres?

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)*
> Garrick: That's wack.

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)*
> Seth: You were a bit too hostile

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)*
> Burner: Of course it was bread involved. that's low.

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)*
> Seth: I just solved that.

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)*


*D: I was a god.*

**Sean** *(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)*
> Seth: Plus you forgot my smokes

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)*
> Garrick: Keyword: was. You're a flower now.

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)*
8ball does Iris pick up Diver?

**FFBot** *(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)*
Flip a coin with 8coin. Heads is yes, tails is no.

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)*
> Garrick: Bound to a Floran.

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)*
8coin

**FFBot** *(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)*
Heads.

**Brody** *(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)*


*D: and you don't have legs, what about it?*

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)*


*Iris is holding Diver now.*

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)*


*Diver quacks unhappily*

**Trey** *(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)*
> Garrick: Movement is easier without legs.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)*
> Emmett: I do not associate with her.

**Bill** *(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)*
> Burner: Drop him. I'm not asking nicely

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)*


*Noting his displeasure, Iris puts him down.*

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)*
8ball do I find a secret light switch and flood the room with light?

**FFBot** *(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)*
Yes, definitely.

**Lili** *(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)*
> Iris: I'm not an asshole, I won't hold him if he doesn't want me to.

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)*
> Emmett: Aha!

**Zander** *(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)*

**Sean** *(18-May-20 04:30 PM)*
> Seth: “A double McSpanky with fries and a Flurp, that'll be $6.53. And $3.47 is your change” I hear Jimmy Neutron say. I never saw that little fuck press the buttons with food on them, so I had to go speak to him. “Dude, you're supposed to press the buttons with the pictures of food on ‘em”. I say. “Don't need to Skeet, I memorized the prices and did the tax and change in my head” he replies. Ever since he fucking started at this job, he insists on trying to make things harder on them. Just last week, he had the fucking nerve to call salt “Sodium Chloride”. No, you fuckwad, just call it salt. No one gives a shit how you know the basic chemical name of fucking salt. Not to mention that it's not even 100% sodium chloride, it's 98% sodium chloride with 2% trace elements. But he just insists on calling it sodium chloride. This was my moment to ruin this fucking nerd. “Dude, you do know that the pictures there aren't just for prices, right? They are logged and from there, the managers can get a rough estimate on how much food has been used and they can subtract the amount used by their stock so they know how much to order so we don't run out of food for later days. It's not just about prices. And what if you do make a mistake? Even a few cents missing from your drawer will result in potentially a write up, and doing it on numerous shifts can result in you getting fired, especially if you're missing a good amount of money

**Trey** *(22-May-20 03:45 PM)*


*Garrick returns to the ship with a hunk of visibly rotten meat.*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 03:45 PM)*
> Garrick: No need.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:45 PM)*
> Emmett: Where youu gunna get the meat?

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:45 PM)*
> Sanya: What is that?

**Trey** *(22-May-20 03:45 PM)*
> Garrick: ...meat.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:46 PM)*


*Iris gives Garrick the most disgusted glare he's ever seen her wear.*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 03:46 PM)*
> Garrick: Mystery meat.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:46 PM)*
> Emmett: We're stuck on a blimey assteroid with no hot chicks to bang!

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:46 PM)*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:46 PM)*
> Iris: I don't joke about food.

**Trey** *(22-May-20 03:46 PM)*
> Garrick: Nothing's wrong with it. I just found it.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:46 PM)*


*Emmett started to cry a little.*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:46 PM)*
> Emmett: I'm gonna be alone fureverr..

**Bill** *(22-May-20 03:47 PM)*
8ball are almost all of the pastry and pasta related ingredients gone from the kitchen?

**FFBot** *(22-May-20 03:47 PM)*
Yes, definitely :8ball:

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:47 PM)*


*Sanya gives Emmett a light kick.*

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:47 PM)*

**Sean** *(22-May-20 03:47 PM)*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:47 PM)*
Thanks Seth

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:47 PM)*
> Iris: I'll get actual, not rotten meat, while I'm out at the store.

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 03:47 PM)*
> Wemmfort: Man, I really need a glass of glass.

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 03:47 PM)*
> Wemmfort: I'm thirsty.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:47 PM)*


*Emmett latched onto Sanya's foot.*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:47 PM)*
> Emmett: Yourre not goin anywhere.

**Trey** *(22-May-20 03:48 PM)*
> Garrick: So picky.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:48 PM)*
> Emmett: You're staying wif me.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:48 PM)*
> Iris: And then when I get back I'll make, like, tacos or something.

**Trey** *(22-May-20 03:48 PM)*
> Garrick: Well, I'll go with you.

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 03:48 PM)*
> Wemmfort: Wemmfort finds a glass bottle, breaks it, and eats the shards from the ground.

**Trey** *(22-May-20 03:48 PM)*
> Garrick: Too many crackheads here right now.

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 03:49 PM)*
> Wemmfort: That was really refreshing.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:49 PM)*
> Emmett: I didn't take crack, Garrick.

*Emmett says this with a surprisingly elegant tone.*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 03:49 PM)*
> Garrick: Grassheads, then.

**Trey** *(22-May-20 03:49 PM)*
> Garrick: Meaning you and Sanya.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:50 PM)*
> Iris: Alright. Anybody else coming?

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 03:50 PM)*
> Wemmfort: Hey! Does anybody want some glass?

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:50 PM)*
> Sanya: Get off.

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:50 PM)*


*She lifts her leg so that she can talk to the goat better*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:51 PM)*
> Emmett: You better watch out for the woman that'll follow you, ghosty mann.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:51 PM)*
> Iris: Alright yeah, let's go Garrick.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:51 PM)*


*Emmett was talking nonsense, it seemed.*

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:51 PM)*
8ball Does Sanya shake Emmett off of her?

**FFBot** *(22-May-20 03:51 PM)*
Most likely :8ball:

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:51 PM)*
> Sanya: Get.

**Trey** *(22-May-20 03:51 PM)*
> Garrick: Oh, come on. Iris isn't that bad.

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:51 PM)*


*Sanya picks Emmett up by the back of his shirt*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:52 PM)*


*Emmett falls on his back, his mouth in a smirk.*
> Emmett: I'm all ayourss, wona-

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 03:52 PM)*


*Wemmfort throws some glass next to garrick.*
> Wemmfort: You'd seem like you'd like this.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:52 PM)*
> Emmett: PUT ME DOWN.

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:52 PM)*
> Sanya: Nope.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:52 PM)*
> Emmett: NOW.

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:52 PM)*
> Sanya: Im not putting you down until you're more sober.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:52 PM)*
> Iris: Alright, looks like nobody else is coming.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:53 PM)*
> Emmett: Squommy pleasse...

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:53 PM)*
> Iris: Let's get going.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:53 PM)*
> Emmett: I've been a good boy...

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:53 PM)*


*Sanya is unfazed.*

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 03:53 PM)*
8ball should Wemmfort scrape Emmett off Sanya's leg?
(edited)

**FFBot** *(22-May-20 03:53 PM)*
Without a doubt :8ball:

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:54 PM)*


*Emmett suddenly roundhouse kicks Sanya's stomach and hops out of her grasp.*

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:54 PM)*
> Sanya: Ow.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:54 PM)*
> Emmett: Die.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:54 PM)*
8ball do we finally go to the store

**FFBot** *(22-May-20 03:54 PM)*
Most likely :8ball:

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:55 PM)*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:55 PM)*
8ball Is there even a grocery store on the asteroid?

**Trey** *(22-May-20 03:55 PM)*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:56 PM)*


*Iris nods.*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:56 PM)*
> Emmett: Woe is you, oh boo ho-

*Emmett was beginning to choke.*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:56 PM)*
> Iris: Alright, let's head in.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:57 PM)*


*Emmett was hitting himself in the stomach.*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:57 PM)*


*The store isn't huge, but it's got a strangely wide variety of food.*

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:58 PM)*


*Sanya rolls away before disaster*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 03:58 PM)*


*The duo spend, like, 20 minutes trying to find normal meat.*

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 03:58 PM)*


*Wemmfort starts to try to talk to emmett.*
> Wemmfort: So, uh, you like glass?

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:58 PM)*


*Emmett swallows, following with a visible twitch.*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:58 PM)*
> Iris: Oh, there it is.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:58 PM)*
> Emmett: No more games, funny wonan.

**Trey** *(22-May-20 03:58 PM)*
> Garrick: I didn't think uncooked alien meat would look this suspicious...

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:59 PM)*


*Sanya hides behind the couch*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:59 PM)*


*Iris lifts up one of the strange meats.*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 03:59 PM)*
> Emmett: I'm going to grab you now!

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 03:59 PM)*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 03:59 PM)*
> Iris: I know this one!

**Brody** *(22-May-20 03:59 PM)*
> Sanya: Oh no you won't.

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:00 PM)*
> Garrick: Hope you're a good judge of food, because it all looks bad to me.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:00 PM)*


*Iris nods.*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:00 PM)*
> Iris: If I weren't a ribbon dancer, I'd have been a chef.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:00 PM)*


*Emmett tackles onto Sanya, trying to pick her up.*
> Emmett: I have brutal strength!

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 04:00 PM)*
> Wemmfort: I'm getting kinda hungry.

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:00 PM)*
> Garrick: Well, you certainly fulfill that role now.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:00 PM)*


*Iris smiles at him.*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:01 PM)*
> Garrick: Anyways, let's get out of here.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:01 PM)*
> Iris: Thanks, that's really nice of you to say.

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:01 PM)*
> Sanya: No you dont.

*She picks him up.*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:01 PM)*
> Garrick: Yeah, sure.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:01 PM)*
> Emmett: What the fuck.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:01 PM)*


*She nods and goes to buy the mountain of food they picked up along the way.*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:01 PM)*
> Emmett: How are you so strong?

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 04:02 PM)*


*Sanya changes Emmett's physical properties and now he's a basketball*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:02 PM)*
> Garrick: You... have the money for all this, right?

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:02 PM)*


*Iris pauses.*

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:02 PM)*
> Sanya: I was sent to assassinate a famous Basketball player, so i know a thing or two about THIS!

*She throws him into the kitchen*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:03 PM)*
> Iris: ...I do, but that's pretty much all of my money.

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 04:03 PM)*
8ball does wemmfort try to find the ship?

**FFBot** *(22-May-20 04:03 PM)*
Outlook not so good :8ball:

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:03 PM)*


*Emmett braced for impact, but surprisingly, the impact wasn't too bad. He made a fake cracking noise and went dead silent.*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:03 PM)*
> Iris: ...do you wanna just steal it?

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:03 PM)*


*Garrick reaches into his pockets and pulls out 36.*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:03 PM)*
> Garrick: Yes.

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:03 PM)*
> Garrick: Good idea.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:04 PM)*
> Iris: Let's go.

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:04 PM)*
> Sanya: I know you're not dead. That throw wasn't even strong enough to kill a 5 year old.

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:04 PM)*


*The duo rushes out of the store, setting off alarms.*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:04 PM)*
> Emmett: You fucking broke my arm though.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:04 PM)*


*Iris laughs.*

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:04 PM)*
> Sanya: Good. Breaking bones builds character.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:04 PM)*
> Iris: I've never stolen anything before! This is kinda fun.

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 04:05 PM)*


*Sanya turns into a wizard and turns a random baby into a beer bottle*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:05 PM)*
> Garrick: Isn't it?? Nobody else gets the thrill!

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:05 PM)*


*Emmett howled in pain to try and get more of a reaction.*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:05 PM)*
8ball does a weird-looking crater attract the attention of Garrick

**FFBot** *(22-May-20 04:05 PM)*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:06 PM)*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:07 PM)*
8ball Does Garrick also see a pink blur in his peripheral vision?

**FFBot** *(22-May-20 04:07 PM)*
It is decidedly so :8ball:

**FFBot** *(22-May-20 04:07 PM)*
No, you are poop.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:08 PM)*


*Emmett sighed.*

**Bill** *(22-May-20 04:11 PM)*
> Burner: Those weren't two people from the ship, were they?

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:11 PM)*


*Emmett sat down next to Sanya, albeit sloppily.*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:12 PM)*
> Garrick: I'd call that a successful escape.

**Bill** *(22-May-20 04:12 PM)*


*Diver quacks back*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:12 PM)*


*Iris laughs.*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:12 PM)*


*Garrick looks up to see a figure looming above the hole.*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:12 PM)*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:19 PM)*


*Unfortunately, Seth ran out of pee eventually, only creating a 5" pool.*

**Sean** *(22-May-20 04:20 PM)*

8ball does the cavern begin to shake rapidly?

**FFBot** *(22-May-20 04:28 PM)*
My sources say no :8ball:

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:29 PM)*
> Iris: Very deep.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:29 PM)*


*Uncharacteristically, mostly because he's drunk and irrational*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:29 PM)*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:33 PM)*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:33 PM)*

**Bill** *(22-May-20 04:33 PM)*
> Burner: What are you two even trying to find down here?

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:33 PM)*
> Garrick: Yeah, we left them up there in our escape.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:33 PM)*
> Emmett: I'd just be giving into their demands.

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:34 PM)*
> Sanya: I'll take them back to the ship.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:34 PM)*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:34 PM)*

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 04:35 PM)*
> Wemmfort: Anyway, where is everybody?

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:35 PM)*

**Bill** *(22-May-20 04:35 PM)*


*Diver lowers his body and starts growling*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:35 PM)*
> Iris: Hey, calm down guys.

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:35 PM)*
> Emmett: No one is even responding to me. Though, they may have be turned down.

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 04:36 PM)*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:36 PM)*
> Garrick: Are you done, Emmett?

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:36 PM)*


*Emmett's clearly sobered up by this point.*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:36 PM)*


*Iris has Emmett turned down.*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:36 PM)*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:36 PM)*
> Garrick: If you died, we'd have no pilot or acting captain.

**Bill** *(22-May-20 04:36 PM)*

**Bill** *(22-May-20 04:37 PM)*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:37 PM)*


*Emmett turns around.*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:37 PM)*
> Emmett: What do you want?

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:38 PM)*


*Iris sighs, gesturing to the trash cave.*

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:38 PM)*


*She picks him up and puts him in the shopping cart.*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:38 PM)*
> Iris: Should we go now?

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:38 PM)*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:39 PM)*

Don't count on it :8ball:

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:39 PM)*


*Emmett crosses his arms.*

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:39 PM)*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:41 PM)*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:41 PM)*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:41 PM)*


*Iris turns Emmett up a little, enough to catch what he's saying from time to time.*

**Bill** *(22-May-20 04:41 PM)*


*Burner moves to the front, Diver a little bit behind her*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:41 PM)*
> Emmett: The llamanians want to decapitate me and make my head their mantlepiece!

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:42 PM)*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:42 PM)*
> Iris: Garrick are you coming?

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:42 PM)*
> Emmett: ... No.

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:42 PM)*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:43 PM)*

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 04:44 PM)*
he was looking for the ship

**Bill** *(22-May-20 04:44 PM)*
> Burner: Hopefully theres an exit somewhere

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:44 PM)*
> Sanya: Then it's a small issue. If you want to talk about everything, don't say that the small things are bothering you.

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:44 PM)*
> Sanya: You have to start with the big things.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:44 PM)*
> Iris: This is so cool.

**Bill** *(22-May-20 04:44 PM)*
> Burner: I doubt anything would settle down here without at least one surface exit

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:44 PM)*


*Iris goes ahead a bit, wandering around the ruins in amazement.*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:44 PM)*
> Garrick: Weird... who would want to settle down here?

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:44 PM)*
> Emmett: I'm pretty irrational when I'm hard as a boulder.

*Emmett still hasn't remembered to turn off his comms.*

**Bill** *(22-May-20 04:45 PM)*
> Burner: I can scan the area hold on

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:45 PM)*
> Sanya: Comms are on. Might not want to talk about that.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:45 PM)*
> Iris: Gross, Emmett.

**Bill** *(22-May-20 04:46 PM)*


*Burner takes flight and starts scanning the cavern, this leaves Diver alone, poking through rubble with his beak*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:47 PM)*
> Iris: See anything cool, Diver?

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:47 PM)*
8ball Does Sanya start putting the groceries up?

**FFBot** *(22-May-20 04:47 PM)*
Yes, definitely :8ball:

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:47 PM)*


*Emmett paused for a moment and turned off his comm.*
> Emmett: I mean, it really isn't that much of an issue when most of the crew has seen me naked.

*He was clearly trying to push off his embarrassment.*

**Bill** *(22-May-20 04:47 PM)*


*Diver looks over and quacks, then keeps trying to dig something out*

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:47 PM)*


*Sanya puts Emmett on the counter and starts to put up groceries.*
> Sanya: I guess that's right.

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:48 PM)*


*Iris heads over and helps him dig.*

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:48 PM)*


*Emmett, playing along, kicks his legs as he's on the counter.*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:49 PM)*


*Muffled beeping starts to play.*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:50 PM)*


*Iris' eyes widen and she reels back.*

**Bill** *(22-May-20 04:50 PM)*

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:51 PM)*
> Sanya: What, pain or horny?

**Zander** *(22-May-20 04:51 PM)*
> Emmett: No real grocery stores or family facilities on Vortox-56.

*Emmett ignored her response.*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 04:51 PM)*


*Iris tries to scoop up Diver and take him away from the bomb.*

**Brody** *(22-May-20 04:51 PM)*
> Sanya: Oh, the counter.

**Trey** *(22-May-20 04:52 PM)*


*The pile of trash explodes, with Iris and Diver barely being caught in the blast.*

**Cooldude** *(22-May-20 04:52 PM)*


*Wemmfort walks towards the sun, because that's where he assumes they are.**He ends up getting even more lost.*

**Trey** *(22-May-20 05:10 PM)*

**Lili** *(22-May-20 05:10 PM)*

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:03 PM)*
> Seth: I got my delivery.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:03 PM)*


*Emmett couldn't understand Iris. He just entered the shower and closed the curtain. The hatch wasn't locked, anyhow.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:03 PM)*


*she turns swiftly back into herself, getting a better idea that is less likely to upset her friend.*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:03 PM)*
8ball does Garrick watch the shenanigans unfold from a distance

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 04:03 PM)*
It is certain.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:03 PM)*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:06 PM)*

*Sanya sits in the cockpit, realizing she has no knowledge of how to drive*

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:09 PM)*

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:09 PM)*


*Seth heads to the cockpit*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:09 PM)*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:10 PM)*


*Iris takes this moment to shift into Olag and mimick his voice, but with a really high pitch.*

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:10 PM)*

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:10 PM)*

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:20 PM)*
> Seth: She'll live man.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:20 PM)*


*Garrick returns to his room to log the failure of his prank.*

**Hunter** *(26-May-20 04:20 PM)*


*Rachel takes a peek at the cockpit her face still absorbing some of that metal that stuck to her earlier.*
> Rachell: What is happening? Please report.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:20 PM)*
8ball does Iris throw a towel at Emmett

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 04:20 PM)*
No, but something that the person after you decides upon happens.

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:20 PM)*
> Seth: I handled her like this way before you ever were born.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:20 PM)*
> Sanya: Seth's driving the same way he lives: Recklessly.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:20 PM)*
> Emmett: Seth's ruining my ship.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:20 PM)*


*Emmett was flaccid and clearly upset.*

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:21 PM)*
> Seth: Im not but ok

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:21 PM)*
8ball Do I walk up on Emmett and Iris' fiasco?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 04:21 PM)*
Of course not!

**Hunter** *(26-May-20 04:21 PM)*
> Rachell: I think one of the walls may have a hole in it now.

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:21 PM)*


*Dakari walking towards the cockpit*

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:21 PM)*
> Dakari: What are you guys doing, and why is Emmett butt naked?

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:22 PM)*
> Emmett: Oh.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:22 PM)*
> Emmett: Hello then.

**Cooldude** *(26-May-20 04:22 PM)*
> Wemmfort: Stop looking at him.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:22 PM)*
> Iris: Clothes, Emmett!

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:22 PM)*
> Sanya: Seth decided to drive.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:22 PM)*


*Emmett looks down and shrugs.*
> Emmett: Well, Seth did decide to drive.

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:22 PM)*
> Dakari: We're doomed then.

**Hunter** *(26-May-20 04:22 PM)*
> Rachell: What is that flesh wand, Emmett?

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:22 PM)*
> Emmett: I mean, can someone grab me my clothes from-

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:22 PM)*
> Emmett: Flesh... Wand?

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:23 PM)*


*Garrick returns to the cockpit, pulls out some pants, and throws them at Emmett.*

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:23 PM)*
8ball does anyone seem to notice the sentient water slithering around their ship?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 04:23 PM)*
Yes.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:23 PM)*
> Garrick: Pants.

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:23 PM)*
> Volentina: What the fuck is this

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:23 PM)*
> Emmett: That's what we call a Dick in my culture.

**Hunter** *(26-May-20 04:23 PM)*
> Rachell: Yes, that thing, between you legs, my research must continue.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:23 PM)*
> Sanya: Don't even try it, weirdo.

**Hunter** *(26-May-20 04:23 PM)*
> Rachell: I must examine it, now.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:23 PM)*


*Iris chokes a bit on air, cheeks turning red.*

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:23 PM)*


*moves around as a puddle*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:23 PM)*
> Garrick: Seth might let you examine him.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:24 PM)*
> Iris: Guys can you please stop talking about Emmett's dick??

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:24 PM)*
> Emmett: It's my cock.

*The pants were clearly too small. He, using the pants like a sockpuppet, covered his willy.*

**Silas** *(26-May-20 04:24 PM)*
haha penis

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:24 PM)*


*Volonta grabs the mop and readies it to clean the puddle*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:24 PM)*
> Garrick: No, it's the topic of conversation right now. Get over it.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:24 PM)*
> Emmett: This is not like the typical jobs I'd sign up for.

**Cooldude** *(26-May-20 04:24 PM)*
I'm in pain

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:24 PM)*


*runs away from the mop*

**Hunter** *(26-May-20 04:24 PM)*
> Rachell: The 'Seth' person is quite creepy, please, keep him away from me.

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:24 PM)*


*Seth turns up the speed on the ship*

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:24 PM)*


*Volonta chases the puddle*

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:24 PM)*
> Seth: Emmett, turn on the warp drive for me

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:24 PM)*
> Emmett: We have moving water-

*Emmett slid to another wall.*

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:24 PM)*
> Sanya: Hey, she got lesson 1 of the Vortox Pummelers down.

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:25 PM)*
> Seth: I don't think Olag unwrapped it yet

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:25 PM)*


*Iris holds her hand out to Rachell.*
> Iris: I don't think we've officially met, my name is Iris!

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:25 PM)*


*moves between Emmett's legs*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:25 PM)*
> Emmett: The fuck is that thing?

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:25 PM)*


*runs towards the kitchen*

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:25 PM)*
> Volentina: Sentient puddle. I have no fucking clue.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:25 PM)*
> Emmett: OKAY, OKAY.

*Emmett stands up.*
> Emmett: Who wants to go with me to the engine room?

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:26 PM)*


*He chases again*

**Hunter** *(26-May-20 04:26 PM)*


*Rachell looks at Iris, then her hand, it's a blank unfeeling stare.*

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:26 PM)*
> Dakari: You know what, I'll go.

**Hunter** *(26-May-20 04:26 PM)*
> Rachell: Hello, Iris.

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:26 PM)*


*moves under Volonta and tries to trip him*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:26 PM)*


*Iris turns her head towards Emmett.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:26 PM)*
> Iris: I'll go!

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:26 PM)*
> Dakari: I've been awake for 5 minutes, and I already need a break.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:26 PM)*
> Emmett: Let's go, Iris and Dakari.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:26 PM)*


*She retracts her hand before looking at Rachell.*
> Iris: What's your name?

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:27 PM)*


*volonta just lifts his foot up and shoves the mop down towards the puddle*

**Hunter** *(26-May-20 04:27 PM)*
> Rachell: Rachell, that is my designation.

**Charles** *(26-May-20 04:27 PM)*


*Vargas wanders around deep space for a bit.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:27 PM)*


*Iris smiles.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:27 PM)*


*Emmett was now awkwardly erect, the pants moving upward.*
> Emmett: Can we get going?

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:27 PM)*
> Sanya: I'll stay here and make sure Seth doesn't kill us all.

**Hunter** *(26-May-20 04:27 PM)*
8ball Does Rachell attempt physical contact with Iris?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 04:27 PM)*
Outlook bad.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:27 PM)*
> Iris: Nice to meet you Rachell, I've gotta go!

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:27 PM)*
> Dakari: Let's

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:28 PM)*
> Garrick: Yo. Valantia.

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:28 PM)*


*separates so the mop doesn't hit him*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:28 PM)*
> Garrick: Where are you?

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:28 PM)*
> Volentina: Trying to mop up an unmoppable puddle

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:28 PM)*
> Iris: We'll talk later though, okay?

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:28 PM)*
`

**Cooldude** *(26-May-20 04:28 PM)*
8ball Does Garrick get stuck in his own pocket?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 04:28 PM)*
Yes, but with a caveat decided by the next person.

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:28 PM)*


*starts rising to reveal his Torrid form*

**Hunter** *(26-May-20 04:28 PM)*


*Rachell gives Iris another blank stare.*
> Rachell: Ok, if you suffer any psychological or physical damage, procure my assistance.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:28 PM)*


*Walks off towards the engine room, looking around for any slimy changes.*

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*
> Theylin: HELLO!

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*
> Theylin: HOW ARE YOU?!

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*
> Garrick: Okay, well, when you get done, I have a job for you.

**Charles** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*
> Vargas: I see a person flying like a a maniac.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*
> Garrick: It's easy.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*


*Iris nods, smiling as she jogs backwards.*

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*
> Theylin: CAN. YOU. HEAR. ME!?

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*
8ball Does Dakari notice any notable sliminess in the engine room?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*
Without a doubt.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*
> Iris: Alright, i will!

**Charles** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*


*Vargas sees a person flying like a maniac.*

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*
> Theylin: I. AM. PEACEFUL!

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*
> Volentina: So you aren't a puddle. Figures.

*Volonta stops trying to mop up the 'puddle'*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*
> Emmett: Oh my Squoat.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:29 PM)*


*She turns to follow Emmett properly.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:30 PM)*
> Emmett: Why did he ruin everything?

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:30 PM)*
> Dakari: I think your friend left quite a gift for you Emmett...

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:30 PM)*
> Theylin: CAN. YOU. UNDERSTAND. MY. SPEAK?!

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:30 PM)*


*Volonta then goes to find Garrick*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:30 PM)*
> Garrick: What's the deal, Emmett?

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:30 PM)*


*follows the newcomer*

**Hunter** *(26-May-20 04:30 PM)*


*Rachell keeps following Emmett, well, more like stalking him.*

**Charles** *(26-May-20 04:31 PM)*
> Vargas: That ship almost hit me!

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:31 PM)*
> Sanya: Well, Seth, what's at this station we're heading to?

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:31 PM)*
8ball does Emmett turn into a marble?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 04:31 PM)*
I guess so.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:31 PM)*


*Emmett shivered.*
> Emmett: Stay in here for me. I'm getting my clothes on. I don't want anymore of Olag's stuff on me. Especially not my....

*Emmett rolled away to the restroom before finishing his statement.*

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:31 PM)*
> Seth: Its a pirate station

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:31 PM)*
> Theylin: CAN. ANYONE. SHOW. ME. TO. THIS. SHIP'S. CAPTAIN?!

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:31 PM)*


*Iris nods.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:31 PM)*
> Iris: Yeah I'll wait here.

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:31 PM)*


*Volonta tapped on Garrick's shoulder*
> Volentina: You needed me?

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:32 PM)*


*Volonta's hand phases through Garrick, and Volonta falls through him.*

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:32 PM)*
> Sanya: Pirates? I may have to wait this one out.

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:32 PM)*


*wanders around the ship*

**Charles** *(26-May-20 04:32 PM)*


*Vargas follows that ship to cuss out their pilot.*

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:32 PM)*
> Volentina: Oh. Uh. Sorry?

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:32 PM)*
> Seth: No no no

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:33 PM)*


*Emmett turns back into himself and puts his clothes back on. In particular, he was wearing the red sweater with the yellow shoulder pads. He then left to the engine room.*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:33 PM)*
> Garrick: Yeah, I need you in the storage room again.

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:33 PM)*
> Seth: By pirate station I mean its not GU oriented.

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:33 PM)*


*wanders around the ships, seemingly stumbling into an engine room*

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:33 PM)*
> Volentina: Does it require the mop? If so I'd need to clean it.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:33 PM)*
> Garrick: No.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:33 PM)*
> Garrick: Come.

*Garrick trails off towards the storage room.*

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:33 PM)*
> Theylin: HELLO?! I. COME. IN. PEACE!

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:33 PM)*


*Volonta began to follow Garrick*

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:33 PM)*
> Theylin: WHERE. IS. THE. SHIP'S. CAPTAIN?

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:33 PM)*


*He nudged Iris kiddingly.*
> Emmett: I mean, I'm just too hot for you guys to handle.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:33 PM)*
> Emmett: Dakari.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:33 PM)*
> Emmett: Can you pave a way to the warp drive?

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:34 PM)*


*Iris chuckles.*

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:34 PM)*
> Sanya: Oh, that's better. I had a hit on a big wig Pirate in my early days. People still hunt me out for it.

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:34 PM)*
> Dakari: Yea, no problem I suppose.

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:34 PM)*


*just looks around the... lack-luster engine room*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:34 PM)*


*Garrick points towards a huge pile of overflowing boxes.*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:34 PM)*
> Garrick: So, that's gotta go. Do you know how to use the airlock?

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:35 PM)*


*mumbles*
> Theylin: not the greatest engine

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:35 PM)*
8ball Does the warp drive get set into place?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 04:35 PM)*
Outlook bad.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:35 PM)*
> Emmett: Olag's an idiot.

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:35 PM)*
> Volentina: I can't say I do. Never been on a ship, so it's safe to say no.

**Hunter** *(26-May-20 04:35 PM)*


*There are two holes inside the ship shaped like Rachell's face, do not question them.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:35 PM)*
> Emmett: He didn't even get this put in.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:35 PM)*


*Iris nods, turning into pink Olag.*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:36 PM)*
> Garrick: Hmm... well, we can take care of that later, I guess.

**Charles** *(26-May-20 04:36 PM)*
> Vargas: Vargas starts to contact the dumbass drivers ship.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:36 PM)*
> Iris: I'm Olag and I fixed your ship and I'm charging 100,000 Ducketts.

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:36 PM)*
> Dakari: Gosh... I didn't realize you could change forms Iris.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:36 PM)*


*Emmett sees Iris and jumps up and latches on the roof. This wasn't too hard, given lack of gravity in the engine room.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:36 PM)*


*She turns back into herself.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:36 PM)*
> Iris: You okay Emmett?

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:36 PM)*
> Emmett: Iris, you can shapeshift?

*He was noticeably shivering.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:36 PM)*
> Iris: I couldn't change forms until, like, yesterday.

**Charles** *(26-May-20 04:37 PM)*
> Vargas: Hello hello? Can you hear me?

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:37 PM)*
> Iris: Remember that thing with the pink ghost?

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:37 PM)*
> Emmett: Oh. That.

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:37 PM)*
> Dakari: No, wasn't there.

**Preston** *(26-May-20 04:37 PM)*


*Volonta just shrugs and walks towards the bathroom to wash the mop*

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:37 PM)*


*Seth steadily speeds up the ship*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:37 PM)*


*Emmett falls and starts to lift the warp drive.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:37 PM)*
> Emmett: Help out.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:37 PM)*
> Iris: Well I kind of absorbed a ghost and now I can shapeshift and touch ghosts.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:38 PM)*


*Garrick is interested in their conversation, and regroups with Iris and the others.*
> Garrick: So, how's that going anyways?

**Michael** *(26-May-20 04:38 PM)*


*starts examining the engine*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:38 PM)*
> Garrick: Is she somehow conscious?

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:38 PM)*


*Iris turns into pink Emmett.*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:38 PM)*
> Garrick: Any voices in your head so far?

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:38 PM)*
> Dakari: That's... useful.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:38 PM)*
8ball Does Sanya leave Seth to his devices?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 04:38 PM)*
Outlook bad.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:38 PM)*
> Emmett: Is that comfortable for you?

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:38 PM)*
> Sanya: I still don't trust you alone.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:38 PM)*
> Sanya: Especially not driving.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:38 PM)*
> Iris: It's basically fine except for the part where I'm pink when I'm in any form other than mine.

**Charles** *(26-May-20 04:39 PM)*
8ball does Vargas boards the wavering ship.

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 04:39 PM)*
It is certain.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:39 PM)*
> Emmett: I kinda find it... hot.

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:39 PM)*
> Dakari: Get a room.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:39 PM)*
> Garrick: Sounds like a win-win to me.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:39 PM)*


*Emmett, despite asking for help, lifts the warp drive and sets it into place.*

**Charles** *(26-May-20 04:39 PM)*
> Vargas: Hello?

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:39 PM)*


*Dakari begins helping Emmett with the warp drive*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:39 PM)*
> Iris: And sometimes i have vivid dreams about being sucked into a pink void.

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:39 PM)*
> Dakari: My bad.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 04:39 PM)*
> Garrick: Turn into a Squoatling and fulfill Emmett's biggest desires.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:39 PM)*
> Iris: But other than that!

**Charles** *(26-May-20 04:40 PM)*


*Vargas searches for people.*

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:40 PM)*
> Dakari: See, you clearly had the warp drive handled.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:40 PM)*


*Emmett was panting from the weight.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:40 PM)*


*Iris turns back into herself, stretching.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:40 PM)*
> Emmett: That's pretty realistic...

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:40 PM)*
> Sanya: Seth, we got an intruder.

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:40 PM)*


*Dakari slaps Emmett on the back*

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 04:40 PM)*
> Dakari: Good job

**Charles** *(26-May-20 04:40 PM)*
*Vargas stomps his way around till he finds the cockpit
(edited)

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:41 PM)*
> Iris: Except for the part where I'm pink, it's a perfect replication.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:41 PM)*
> Emmett: Could you turn back to the Squoatling for-

*Emmett fell over from the slap.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:41 PM)*


*She changes her voice to Emmett's.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:41 PM)*
> Iris: I can do voices, too.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:42 PM)*
> Emmett: That sounds nothing like me.

*Emmett's voice was muffled from the ground.*

**Charles** *(26-May-20 04:42 PM)*


*Vargas finds a teleporter.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:42 PM)*


*She laughs, still in Emmett's voice.*

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:42 PM)*
> Seth: Hey you see that ship over there?

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:42 PM)*
> Iris: I'm sure it doesn't.

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:42 PM)*
> Seth: Wanna see me ram it?

**Cooldude** *(26-May-20 04:42 PM)*
Is it my turn?

**Charles** *(26-May-20 04:42 PM)*


*\*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 04:42 PM)*


*She reaches out to offer Emmett her hand.*

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:42 PM)*


*Seth blasts the ship to high hell*

**Brody** *(26-May-20 04:42 PM)*
> Sanya: Yes, Seth. Ram the ship and ignore the current intruder.

**Sean** *(26-May-20 04:43 PM)*
> Seth: Well, now he can't escape

**Charles** *(26-May-20 04:43 PM)*


*Vargas is sent to the cockpit.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 04:43 PM)*


*Looks up at her and smiles softly. He took her hand soon after.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:13 PM)*


*Iris stiffens further and her eyes narrow at Vargas.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:13 PM)*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:13 PM)*


*Emmett took a bite.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:14 PM)*


*Iris is fighting the sudden urge to murder.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:14 PM)*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:15 PM)*
> Garrick: Well, I'll be taking my leave.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:15 PM)*
> Iris: Sanya how do you do this all the time?

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:15 PM)*
> Emmett: No.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:15 PM)*
> Emmett: You're not leaving.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:15 PM)*

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:15 PM)*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:15 PM)*


*Emmett's arm was shaking quickly.*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:15 PM)*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:16 PM)*
> Emmett: What does that even mean?

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:16 PM)*
> Emmett: I'm starting to get pissed off at your lack of clarity.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:16 PM)*


*Emmett was grinding his teeth a bit.*

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:16 PM)*
> Sanya: Emmett. What is going on. You can tell me.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:17 PM)*


*Iris' eyes turn pink.*

**Charles** *(26-May-20 05:17 PM)*
> Vargas: I'm sorry i didn't mean to offend you.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:17 PM)*

**Charles** *(26-May-20 05:17 PM)*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:17 PM)*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:17 PM)*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:17 PM)*
> Iris: Probably for the best.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:17 PM)*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:19 PM)*
> Emmett: But I'm feeling really pissy.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:19 PM)*


*Garrick tosses an unknown green condiment to Emmett.*

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:19 PM)*
> Sanya: What's your grass level at?

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:20 PM)*
> Garrick: Grass smoothie.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:20 PM)*
> Garrick: Or something.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:20 PM)*


*Iris' eyes return to normal as she heads to the kitchen.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:20 PM)*


*Emmett takes the condiment, eats it, and spits it out. His mouth was on fire.*
> Emmett: Garrick, I'm gonna kill you!

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:21 PM)*
> Garrick: Whoa, chill out! I didn't know!

**Sean** *(26-May-20 05:21 PM)*

*Iris makes it to the kitchen.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:21 PM)*


*Emmett took out his Maggo-Pistol and changed its setting to "Spectral".*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:22 PM)*


*Garrick pulls out a Worn Spear.*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:22 PM)*
> Garrick: We don't have to do this, dude.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:22 PM)*
> Sanya: Emmett, do not make a decision you'll regret.

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 05:22 PM)*
> Dakari: Keep it down out there!

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:22 PM)*


*Emmett was twitching a bit.*

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 05:22 PM)*


*Under his voice*
> Dakari: Always so much noise.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:22 PM)*


*D: I have an idea, but he might not like it.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:22 PM)*
> Emmett: I just want to keep things peaceful, but you and your antics have got to go.

**Charles** *(26-May-20 05:23 PM)*


*Vargas pulls out his two laser blades while hopping out the water*
> Vargas:  Calm down Emmet. Calm down.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:23 PM)*
> Garrick: Your fault for drinking some random green sludge.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:23 PM)*

> Emmett: I THOUGHT IT WAS GRASS!

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:23 PM)*
> Garrick: Well, that's your problem!

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:23 PM)*


*Iris starts to bake croissants.*

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:24 PM)*


*Sanya grabs Emmett's arm.*

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:24 PM)*
> Sanya: Do not do this.

**Rashidi** *(26-May-20 05:24 PM)*
8ball Does Dakari go and explore the rest of the ship?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 05:24 PM)*
It is certain.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:24 PM)*


*Emmett backs up from the pool to the edge of the ship. Afterwards, he was grabbed.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:24 PM)*


*Iris is baking croissants.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:24 PM)*
> Emmett: I just really want to be listened to.

**Charles** *(26-May-20 05:25 PM)*
It says indicisive.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:25 PM)*


*Garrick pockets the spear.*

**Michael** *(26-May-20 05:25 PM)*
8ball does Vargas pass out?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 05:25 PM)*
Person who's after you decides!

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*
Yes
> Emmett: I'm unstable, aren't I?

**Michael** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*


*knocks on the Vortox's Pummelers ship door*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*

**Michael** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*
> Theylin: Hello?

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*
> Emmett: Fucking clown.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*
> Garrick: Yeah, man. This isn't what I meant when I said to 'take initiative'.

**Charles** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*


*Vargas wakes up.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*


*Emmett leans back off the railing.*

**Silas** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*
8ball does Vargas feel himself slowly transforming into a marble?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*
N0.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*


*Croissants.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*
> Emmett: I feel empty.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:26 PM)*
> Emmett: Filled with angry spirits.

**Charles** *(26-May-20 05:27 PM)*
*Vargas gets kidnapped. *

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:27 PM)*

**Cooldude** *(26-May-20 05:27 PM)*
8ball Does Emmett pee in the pool?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 05:27 PM)*
Sad to tell you that it does not happen.

**Michael** *(26-May-20 05:27 PM)*
> Theylin: Hello?!

*continues knocking on the door of Seth's ship*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:27 PM)*
8ball Do I zip up Vargas' hands?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 05:27 PM)*
Very doubtful.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:28 PM)*
> Emmett: I need grass.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:28 PM)*
> Emmett: I need grass bad.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:28 PM)*
> Garrick: Sanya, you got any?

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:28 PM)*
> Emmett: How often do you chase that high?

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:28 PM)*
> Sanya: I might.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:28 PM)*


*Iris is just still baking croissants.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:29 PM)*
> Emmett: What high?

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:29 PM)*
> Emmett: This feels terrible!

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:29 PM)*
> Garrick: Is this grass stuff healthy for you?

**Michael** *(26-May-20 05:29 PM)*


*bangs on Seth's ship door*
> Theylin: I know y'all are in there

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:29 PM)*
> Garrick: It's having very adverse effects.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:29 PM)*
> Emmett: That's called a withdrawal where I'm from.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:30 PM)*


*Sanya pulls out Garrick's true identity, then puts it back.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:30 PM)*


*Emmett slid down and held his legs to himself.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:30 PM)*
8ball has Iris baked 1000 croissants?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 05:30 PM)*
You got it.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:30 PM)*
> Emmett: I don't know...?

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:30 PM)*


*Garrick is imbued with immense fear while the index card is exposed.*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:30 PM)*


*He decides to look again...*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:30 PM)*
> Emmett: I've had grass for like, my entire life!

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:30 PM)*


*Sanya glares deep at Garrick, then sits with Emmett.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:31 PM)*
> Emmett: I feel like everyone is staring at me.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:31 PM)*
> Sanya: Because we care.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:31 PM)*
> Emmett: I'm always being stared at.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:31 PM)*


*Iris has baked 1000 croissants and feels a little bit better. She keeps making croissants, though.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:31 PM)*
> Emmett: But the whole galaxy's eyes are on me.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:31 PM)*
> Sanya: Hey, you did end up taking my advice. You wanted people to care, so you made us care.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:32 PM)*
8ball Does Squoat chime in?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 05:32 PM)*
Yo mama. (Yes).

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:32 PM)*
> Garrick: Well, in all fairness, you are the most wanted man right now.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:32 PM)*
> Sanya: The life you live will be and always has been a dangerous one.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:32 PM)*


*To Emmett, this was a loud ass voice. To everyone else, some buzzing was coming from his ears.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:32 PM)*
> Emmett: "SQUEMFET."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:32 PM)*
> Emmett: What?

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:32 PM)*
> Emmett: Who's there?

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:33 PM)*


*D: He is here. Leave the Squoat be.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:33 PM)*
> Emmett: "IT'S ME. SQUOAT."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:33 PM)*
> Emmett: What? How are you speaking to me?

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 05:34 PM)*
Signs point to yes.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:35 PM)*
> Emmett: "I can speak to every Squoatling."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:35 PM)*
> Emmett: "I'm god-I mean, I'm Squoat, remember?"

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:35 PM)*
> Garrick: What's wrong, Dread?

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:36 PM)*
> Emmett: It's been a while since I've seen you.
> Emmett: Is he alright?

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:36 PM)*


*Iris is baking croissants.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:36 PM)*
> Emmett: "Nevermind that. I need to tell you something."

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:36 PM)*


*His god is talking to him.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:36 PM)*
> Emmett: What?

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:36 PM)*
> Garrick: Oh. Good timing.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:36 PM)*


*We should let them commune in peace.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:36 PM)*
> Emmett: "I've been on the run."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:36 PM)*
> Emmett: On the run? What does that even mean? You're Squoat!

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:36 PM)*
> Emmett: "Squoat's gotten himself into some trouble."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:36 PM)*


*Emmett was having a revelation in his mind about now.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:36 PM)*
> Emmett: "I've gotten to a safespace to talk with you."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:36 PM)*
> Emmett: It took you...

*Emmett counts on his digits.*
> Emmett: "Thirteen GUYs. I know."

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:38 PM)*


*When a god communes with an individual, it's normally a big deal. Maybe not for others, but if, say, Sanya met with a group of Florans, she would be treated as a messiah.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:39 PM)*
> Emmett: "Just let me continue. I need you to get off the grass."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:39 PM)*
> Emmett: Why?

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:39 PM)*
> Garrick: Interesting.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:39 PM)*
> Garrick: He certainly looks entranced.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:42 PM)*
> Emmett: "It's terrible for you! Your family got you high on that stuff."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:42 PM)*
> Emmett: "The only reason the Tawfeeks were rich was because of their mass production of grass."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:42 PM)*
> Emmett: "Your parents left you alone a lot to make deals, my son."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:42 PM)*
> Emmett: "You were played."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:42 PM)*
> Emmett: "I know you need grass to live, Emmett. You have fetal grass syndrome or whatever."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:42 PM)*
> Emmett: "But you really need to cut down on it. A lot."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:42 PM)*
> Emmett: "You're going to kill yourself."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:42 PM)*
> Emmett: Uhm.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:42 PM)*
> Emmett: Okay.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:42 PM)*
> Emmett: But I don't know how to stop.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:42 PM)*
> Emmett: "Find a way. I'll tell you a way to find her if you do so."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:42 PM)*
> Emmett: Who?

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:46 PM)*
8ball has Iris made a huge model ship out of croissants in the kitchen

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 05:46 PM)*
It is decidedly so.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:46 PM)*
> Emmett: "Oh, you know. Yo Mama."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:46 PM)*
> Emmett: Who's that?

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:46 PM)*
> Emmett: "It was a joke."

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:46 PM)*
> Emmett: "I'll help you find Squ-"

*Squoat cut off.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:46 PM)*
> Emmett: What? What? What the fuck?

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:49 PM)*


*Hm. It seems like he's gone.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:49 PM)*


*Iris critically examines the model ship of croissants.*

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:49 PM)*
> Sanya: Emmett? Are you alright?

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:49 PM)*
> Garrick: What'd he say? Emmett looks pissed off...

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:49 PM)*
> Garrick: Again.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:49 PM)*
8ball Does Iris run out into the pool suddenly in clothing made of croissants and dive?
(edited)

**FFBot** *(26-May-20 05:49 PM)*
Yes, definitely.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:50 PM)*


*Emmett stood up.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:50 PM)*
> Emmett: Squoat called.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:50 PM)*
> Garrick: Welcome to the party... really good timing, actually.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:50 PM)*


*Communications between gods and mortals should be contained between them. In fact, it's strange that you can even hear me, ghost.*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:50 PM)*
> Garrick: Fair enough.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:51 PM)*
> Emmett: I have a weird feeling about what just happened.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:51 PM)*
> Iris: I baked over 2000 croissants.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:51 PM)*
> Emmett: Like, Squoat didn't seem.... Sacred?

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:51 PM)*
> Garrick: It seems I have a lot of abilities I'm not aware of.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:51 PM)*
> Iris: I feel better now.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:51 PM)*
> Emmett: Does that make sense?

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:51 PM)*
> Iris: Yeah it does.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:51 PM)*
> Sanya: Iris. Where are your normal clothes and why are you wearing croissants?

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:52 PM)*


*Iris sighs.*

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:52 PM)*
> Garrick: I've heard it's like that with people you admire, Emmett.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:52 PM)*
> Iris: I baked too many croissants.

**Trey** *(26-May-20 05:52 PM)*
> Garrick: It's disappointing 9 times out of 10.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:52 PM)*
> Sanya: Here. Let me see if i can help.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:52 PM)*
> Iris: The batter stuck to me and baked.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:52 PM)*


*Emmett sneaked a peek at Iris for a second.*

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:52 PM)*
> Emmett: But, guys.

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:53 PM)*
> Iris: My old clothes are underneath.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:53 PM)*
> Emmett: GARRICK! SANYA!

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:53 PM)*
> Emmett: LISTEN TO ME.

**Zander** *(26-May-20 05:53 PM)*
> Emmett: I need to get off of grass.

**Brody** *(26-May-20 05:53 PM)*


*Sanya turns back to Emmett, putting the weaponized Llama head back in Dread.*

**Lili** *(26-May-20 05:54 PM)*
> Iris: does anybody have a bread knife?

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)*
> Garrick: By the way, Seth.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)*
> Garrick: I found the Ottori girl you rescued a few GUYs ago.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)*


*D: I hate this place.*

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)*
> Garrick: She's alive, somehow.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)*


*Seth shakes his dong around flinging vaginal fluids and cum all over the place*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)*
> Emmett: I'm going to tend to the prisoner.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)*
> Sanya: Garrick, come here.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)*


*Emmett shielded his eyes and proceeded to leave to the brig.*

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)*
> Seth: Thats cool, what about her?

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)*


*Sanya turns off her comms.*

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)*
> Vargas: Can someone let me out so i can wash my shit covered ass and get a change of clothes please?

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)*
> Garrick: She needs a room.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)*
> Emmett: Dude.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)*
> Seth: Why?

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)*
> Garrick: Me and Chomsky only have 2 beds.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)*
> Emmett: There's a toilet literally right next to you.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)*
> Seth: Get another bed then.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)*
> Seth: Heres some money

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)*
> Vargas: this happened when i passed out and died for a second.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)*


*Emmett fingered the numpad for a bit, unlocking the cell door.*

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)*
> Garrick: Alright, I'll just assign her a room myself, then.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)*
> Garrick: What's up, Sanya?

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)*
> Emmett: Can you behave, please?

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)*
> Vargas: Thanks.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)*
> Emmett: We have no prostacian or whatever it is.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)*
> Vargas: As long as my plostacian is ok.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)*


*Seth digs in his urethra and takes  out 300 ducketts, he throws them at Garrick*

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)*
> Seth: Now go buy a bed.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)*


*Sanya starts to whisper*
> Sanya: Garrick, we need to make sure Emmett doesn't go in there.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)*
> Garrick: Gross. Here you go, Sanya.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)*
> Emmett: Where's your "plostacian"?

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)*
> Emmett: I never heard of it.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)*


*Garrick tosses the urethra Ducketts to Sanya.*

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)*


*Vargas sees this as he walks out of the brig*
> Vargas: What the fuck!

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)*
> Garrick: Emmett, do you have another bed?

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)*
> Sanya: Gross.

*She throws them behind her.*

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)*


*Seth turns beet red and begins erupting smoke out of his pores because he is so mad*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)*
> Emmett: What's wrong, 8ball man?

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)*
> Vargas: Nothing.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)*
> Sanya: Garrick, I have an idea.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)*
> Vargas: Its with the stuff you took.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)*
> Garrick: SQUEMFET

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)*
> Emmett: I didn't take anything. Maybe Seth did.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)*


*Seth's head turns into a volcano and starts erupting as Seth starts to uncontrollably scream*

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)*
> Vargas: Take a ounce of it. Its good shit man.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)*
> Emmett: GARRICK, HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

**Preston** *(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)*
8ball Does Volentina have a functioning Gameboy?

**FFBot** *(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)*
Nope.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)*
> Vargas: SEEEEEEEEEEETH.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)*
> Seth: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)*
> Sanya: Why is everyone screaming?

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)*
8ball does emmet really ave my stuff

**FFBot** *(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)*
No.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)*
> Emmett: What the hell is going on?!

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)*
> Garrick: I'VE KNOWN YOUR NAME FOR 4 GUYS. ANYWAYS CAN THE OTTORI ROOM WITH YOU AND DAKARI?!?!

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)*
> Vargas: Give me my plostacian.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)*
> Garrick: Yes. Sanya. What is your plan.

**Preston** *(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)*
Volentina wandered out of the brig, namely away from the noise.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)*
> Vargas: Seth.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)*
> Sanya: Listen, turn off your comms.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)*


*Emmett muttered.*
> Emmett: oh yeah, technically i did tell you that.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)*
> Emmett: I have a bed. There's an Ottori?

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)*
> Sanya: I have an idea. Emmett's currently not in his right mind.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)*
> Seth: FORTNITE FORTNITE FORTNITE

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)*
> Garrick: Yeah, Seth rescued her and she got stuck in my pockets.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)*
> Vargas: PLOSTACIAN WILL CLEAR THAT RIGHT UP!

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)*
> Emmett: I see.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)*
> Vargas: Luckily i have some in my secret shirt pocket.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)*
> Emmett: You want me to make some space?

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)*


*Seth takes out a small wood pipe and puts on an old fashioned suit and tie*

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)*
> Garrick: Yeah, we don't have any space in our room.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)*
> Garrick: You could double up, Sanya.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)*


*Emmett tried to cover his ears from the screaming 8ball head.*

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)*
> Sanya: Actually, i may have an idea

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)*
> Vargas: Yes please.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)*
> Garrick: I'll be right back.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)*


*He then takes out a library with a  fireplace and an armchair*

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)*


*Vargas takes a quick sniff.*

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)*


*Garrick leaves to tell Jess of her room reassignment.*

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)*
> Vargas: Thats some good shit right there.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)*


*Seth pulls a book from the bookcase and then sits down, lighting his pipe*

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)*
> Sanya: If Garrick won't help, i may have to do this myself.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)*
> Emmett: You think she has any skills for the crew?

*Emmett walked over to the crew quarters block.*

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)*
> Vargas: Its better than grass Emmet. I promise.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)*
emet

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)*
> Emmett: Garrick?

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)*
> Seth: Chapter One, Why I hate Mathias

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)*
> Emmett: You turn your coms off?

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)*
> Garrick: No, I can hear you.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)*


*Sanya followed Emmett, walking with him.*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)*
> Emmett: Matthias was kind-of a douche, yeah.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)*
> Garrick: She might. She had to survive in my pockets.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)*


*Vargas follows Emmet.*

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)*
> Vargas: Where are the showers.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)*


*Garrick follows Emmett.*

**Preston** *(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)*
> Volentina: Huh.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)*
> Vargas: By the way my name is Vargas.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)*
> Emmett: Front of the ship and next to the quarters.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)*


*Jessica follows Garrick.*

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)*
> Garrick: Here's your roommate.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)*


*Emmett turns around, seeing the apparent conga line.*

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)*
> Vargas: Thank you also who are you two.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)*
> Emmett: Uh... Oh hi!

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)*
> Sanya: I swear.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)*
> Seth: Reason one, Matthias feigns superiority even though he is a bird that is unable to fly

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)*
> Garrick: "Hey."

*She barely recognizes him.*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)*


*Emmett stiffened his back and put his hoof on the back of his horns.*

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)*
> Garrick: Also, she needs clothes... HEY, SANYA

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)*
> Emmett: Jeez, it's been a long time.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)*
> Sanya: I'll check.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)*
> Vargas: So who are you Two?

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)*
> Seth: Reason 2

*Seth takes a puff of his pipe*
> Seth: I hate birds

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)*
> Garrick: Oh, you're right there.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)*


*Seth blows smoke into the comms, causing smoke to emit from everyone's comms*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)*


*Emmett turns down his comms and tries to have a conversation with the Ottori. He waved away the smoke promptly.*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)*
> Emmett: Let's introduce ourselves again.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)*
> Seth: Reason 3, He is an asshole.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)*
> Emmett: I'm Squemfet Tawfeek, but you can just call me Emmett.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)*
(Sean, Isn't Matthias in your fanny pack)

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)*


*Matthias is angrily cawking from Seth's satchel.*

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)*
Who is in my pockets

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)*
Yes

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)*
> Seth: Chapter 2, My relationship with Goddess of Lust

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)*
> Emmett: Sanya, if it's an issue, I have clothing for her.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)*
> Garrick: "I'm Jessica. Jess is fine."

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)*
> Vargas: Oh never mind its just plostacian.

*Vargas takes a quick bump.*

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)*
> Sanya: Alright.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)*
> Emmett: Follow me, Jess.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)*
> Seth: There once was a fine young lady with a big busom and even bigger tush, I fancied her quite a bit back in my younger years. Every boy in town wanted a go at her, just to know how a romp with her would feel

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)*


*Sanya reaches up her hand to her flower, to receive an old kimono*

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)*
> Sanya: Here.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)*
> Garrick: "Okay."

*She hesitantly follows.*

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)*
Ima wash up see you Sanya? and Garrick?

**Preston** *(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)*
> Volentina: Better.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)*


*Emmett went into his room and opened the closet, making no mind to the sleeping Dakari. In it was a large variety of burgundy red elven shirts with various warm highlights.*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)*
> Emmett: I know I don't have very much variety.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)*
> Sanya: Jesus.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)*
> Vargas: OK.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)*


*Sanya walks over to Emmetts room.*

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)*
> Seth: This isn't about her. Instead, this is about an immortal goddess with perky tits, a flat stomach, and a bouncy ass, the very same one who is the reason for my curse

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)*
> Emmett: Seth, what are you doing?

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)*
> Sanya: Here, something that would fit better.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)*
> Seth: Reading my dear son.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)*
> Garrick: "Huh? Oh, thank you... grass lady."

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)*
> Vargas: Vargas washes up and puts on clean clothes.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)*
> Emmett: You wrote this?

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)*


*Sanya throws the kimono in the room*

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)*
> Sanya: The name is Sanya.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)*


*Emmett shrugged.*
> Emmett: Thought they have nothing.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)*
> Seth: Indeed I did.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)*
> Vargas: Hello everyone.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)*


*Emmett hopped back onto his bed and leaned against the wall.*

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)*
> Vargas: I'm Vargas.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)*
8ball Is the ship there?

**FFBot** *(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)*
You decide. You earned it!

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)*

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)*

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)*


*Garrick comes.*

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)*
> Garrick: Garrick comes.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)*
> Sanya: Do you know how to hardlock a door?

*She whispers*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)*
> Emmett: "THE RESTAURANT, LLAMANIAN UNDERGROUND, HAS ALMOST BEEN REACHED."

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)*
> Vargas: Sooooo Seth, want some drugs?

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)*


*The ottori also puts on actual clothes.*

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)*
> Seth: GARRICK, NO CUMMING

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)*


*Emmett shielded his eyes, respecting her privacy.*

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)*
> Sanya: We need to keep Emmett in here.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)*
> Seth: Im sorry what was that?

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)*
> Vargas: WHAT THE FUCK!!!!

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)*

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:02 PM)*
> Sanya: Good. try to do that.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 04:02 PM)*


*Seth takes out a big horn and puts it in his ear*

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:02 PM)*
8ball Can Garrick hardlock the door?

**FFBot** *(04-Jun-20 04:02 PM)*
Majority rules! Vote on it!

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)*
> Vargas: For some plostacian of course. I just need one ounce.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)*


*Emmett's jaw drops to the floor, his eyes extend at a velocity never before seen, he takes out a boxing glove and hits himself with it 17 times, pants like a dog, and yells AOOOOGA AOOOOGA then turns to the audience and says in 1930's New York accent “HOT MAMA, now that's a dame!”*

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)*
> Seth:  We dont do drugs on this ship

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)*
> Emmett: Vargas. Please shut up.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)*
> Seth: We are drug free

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)*
> Emmett: What are you talking about, Seth?

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)*
> Emmett: You're constantly taking drugs.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)*
> Vargas: Yeah Seth?

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)*
> Emmett: You just don't want me to have my race's drugs.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)*


*Seth turns his head 360 degrees and extends his neck out to Emmett's face*

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)*
> Vargas: Vargas traps Emmet in the ship and headsout as the decoy.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)*


*Garrick sneaks over and shuts the room door while Emmett is AWOOGAing at Jess.*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)*


*Emmett's arms shook a bit from withdrawals.*

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)*
> Seth: Repeat that again sonny?

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)*
> Sanya: Garrick, if you can, i need you to lock him in his room. We can't let him go out there.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)*
> Emmett: I'm turning off video comms.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)*
> Emmett: You're fucking creepy.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)*

Volentina just begins wandering around.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)*

Yes, but with a caveat decided by the person before you.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:06 PM)*


*Emmett looks at the Ottori and frowns a little.*
> Emmett: Sorry for my language.

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 04:06 PM)*
> Seth: shut up boy!

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 04:06 PM)*
> Seth: YOU SHAN'T  SPEAK TO YOUR DADDY THAT WAY

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 04:07 PM)*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:07 PM)*


*Emmett turns off his video comms.*

> Sanya: Nice job. C'mon, we've got a diner to infiltrate.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:07 PM)*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:08 PM)*


*Emmett tries to open his hatch, getting no movement*

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:08 PM)*
Sean, Emmett's room is hardlocked.

*D: No. NO. NOOOOO!*

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)*


*He puts it back in fear and desperation.*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)*
> Emmett: "No, Seth."

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)*
> Sanya: Give it back.

**Michael** *(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)*
8ball does Theylin turn into a puddle and go into Emmett's room?

**FFBot** *(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)*
No but actually yes.

**Michael** *(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)*
> Theylin: Emmett, I'm in your rooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 04:24 PM)*

I just lost the game.

I just lost the game.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:25 PM)*


*Emmett didn't hear Theylin, and instead puts his arms around the Ottori for warmth.*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:25 PM)*
> Emmett: Hope you don't mind this.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:25 PM)*

**Sean** *(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)*
Gtg real quick

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)*
> Emmett: I think Seth tampered with the air conditioning.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)*
> Sanya: When you've found him, lead him back outside.

**Preston** *(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)*
> Volentina: If he actually does manage to find the target, what then? Do we trap it or do we have weapons to attack?

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)*


*Emmett looks to the LED air conditioning unit.*

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)*
> Garrick: "I'm fine."

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)*


*Emmett shivered.*
> Emmett: You want to talk to pass the time?

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)*
> Garrick: If you can successfully complete this mission, we will buy you as many drugs as you want.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)*
> Garrick: I hope you overdose.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)*
> Garrick: Whoops, I didn't mean to say that out loud.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:29 PM)*
> Sanya: See if you can slip some of your drugs in the clients' food.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 04:29 PM)*
> Vargas: Fuck you Garrick.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:29 PM)*
> Sanya: I'll stab him in the bathroom.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:29 PM)*

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:30 PM)*

Richard Jamerez

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)*
> Vargas: 5 ounces is the safe at most. 7ounces ok

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)*
> Garrick: If he dies in the restaurant, it'll be suspicious.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)*
> Emmett: I don't really know why the galaxy is against me.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)*
> Sanya: We don't want him dead in the middle of the restaurant. Exactly

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)*
> Sanya: It's better if someone else finds him dead.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)*
> Emmett: I didn't do anything wrong.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)*
Yeah but it takes a few minutes for it to get through the system

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)*
> Garrick: "Who's after you?"

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)*


*Emmett takes off his watch and sticks it on the bedside table.*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)*
> Emmett: Everyone, really.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)*
> Emmett: Even Vargas, I think. The stupid 8ball guy.

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)*
> Emmett: I don't really do much to protect myself though.

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)*
"I'm after you!" Romantic music starts playing, the lighting becomes sepia, their eyes become hearts

**Michael** *(04-Jun-20 04:33 PM)*
8ball is EmmettFlower canon?

**FFBot** *(04-Jun-20 04:33 PM)*
I guess not.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 04:33 PM)*

**Trey** *(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)*
8ball is there heavy romantic subtext between them

**FFBot** *(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)*
Yes, but with a caveat decided by the next person.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)*
> Vargas: I can set it up to look like he was doing a line.

**Preston** *(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)*
> Volentina: You could put enough in to poison the target, but not enough to kill him near instantly.

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)*
> Sanya: Just listen to me. Get the job done.

**Charles** *(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)*

**Zander** *(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)*


*Emmett pushed his cheek into her fur.*

**Brody** *(04-Jun-20 04:37 PM)*

8ball is Theylin able to draft up a blueprint to show one of the captains for approval?

It is certain.

*Everyone, of course, passes the test, and turn back into their selves soon after.*

**Charles** *(09-Jun-20 06:17 PM)*


*Vargas gags as he looks at Seth.*

**Charles** *(09-Jun-20 06:17 PM)*

**Zander** *(09-Jun-20 06:19 PM)*


*Emmett shrugged.*
> Emmett: I'm not a faggot though. But I appreciate the rebuttal.

**Charles** *(09-Jun-20 06:20 PM)*
> Vargas: Seth is a fag though.

**Zander** *(09-Jun-20 06:20 PM)*
> Emmett: I'm assuming Zarazoga-9 is free from GU influence given the AD check.

**Sean** *(09-Jun-20 06:20 PM)*


*Seth goes back to being Seth and he shoots and kills the other Seth*

**Zander** *(09-Jun-20 06:21 PM)*

No, but something that the person before you decides upon happens.

**Trey** *(09-Jun-20 06:23 PM)*
> Garrick: We didn't tell anyone else, I think Seth is just being insane.

**Charles** *(09-Jun-20 06:24 PM)*


*With a intense stare.*

**Zander** *(09-Jun-20 06:24 PM)*


*Emmett went into Sanya's room and noticed the pot broken. Her bed was messy and there was no trace of her.*

**Zander** *(09-Jun-20 06:27 PM)*
> Emmett: I found the tickets, everyone!

**Trey** *(09-Jun-20 06:27 PM)*
That would be "no"

**Sean** *(09-Jun-20 06:27 PM)*

**Sean** *(09-Jun-20 06:27 PM)*
> Seth: Emmett, come here honey

*Seth rips off his shirt and begins tossing her tits*

**Sean** *(09-Jun-20 06:28 PM)*

**Charles** *(09-Jun-20 06:28 PM)*

Yup.

**Trey** *(09-Jun-20 06:29 PM)*


*Emmett's jaw drops to the floor, his eyes extend at a velocity never before seen, he takes out a boxing glove and hits himself with it 17 times, pants like a dog, and yells AOOOOGA AOOOOGA then turns to the audience and says in 1930's New York accent “HOT MAMA, now that's a dame!”*

**Zander** *(09-Jun-20 06:29 PM)*


*Emmett picked himself up and saw SethSanya.*

**Preston** *(09-Jun-20 06:29 PM)*
> Volentina: Apparently Sanya is flaunting her tits around.

**Zander** *(09-Jun-20 06:29 PM)*
> Emmett: Sanya would never do this. She's afraid of tossing her tits around.

**Trey** *(09-Jun-20 06:29 PM)*


*Garrick is confused and afraid.*

**Charles** *(09-Jun-20 06:30 PM)*
> Vargas: Nice i like it Sayna.

**Sean** *(09-Jun-20 06:30 PM)*


*Seth's head goes 360 degrees and he begins screeching, he gets down into a crab walk and crawls away*

**Preston** *(09-Jun-20 06:30 PM)*
> Volentina: Well then sanya has either changed her mind or someone has a good disguise

**Sean** *(09-Jun-20 06:30 PM)*


*Seth's jaw drops to the floor, his eyes extend at a velocity never before seen, he takes out a boxing glove and hits himself with it 17 times, pants like a dog, and yells AOOOOGA AOOOOGA then turns to the audience and says in 1930's New York accent “HOT MAMA, now that's a dame!”*

**Charles** *(09-Jun-20 06:30 PM)*

**Charles** *(09-Jun-20 06:36 PM)*

**Brody** *(09-Jun-20 06:36 PM)*
(She always has)

**Trey** *(09-Jun-20 06:36 PM)*
We meant nipples

**Brody** *(09-Jun-20 06:36 PM)*

**Trey** *(09-Jun-20 06:37 PM)*
Zander mistyped and I just copied him apparently

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:20 PM)*
> Emmett: We're safe. We have tickets. Please don't turn us into American Dad characters.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:20 PM)*

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:23 PM)*

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:23 PM)*
> Sanya: What is it, Emmett?

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:23 PM)*
> Emmett: You have a doppelganger.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:24 PM)*
8ball Does Seth flash Sanya?

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 04:24 PM)*
You decide. You earned it!

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:24 PM)*


*Emmett looks over to the nippled Sanya and sweats a little.*

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:24 PM)*
> Sanya: "You're pretty hot, sunflower!"

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:25 PM)*
> Emmett: Seth, why?

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:25 PM)*


*Sanya does a double take at the doppleganger*

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:25 PM)*
> Sanya: "Because I can. Plus, Tits."

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:26 PM)*
> Garrick: Are we bringing two Sanyas with us?

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:26 PM)*
> Sanya: If you don't put my shirt back on, i'll show you how it feels to be stabbed as a woman.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:26 PM)*
> Emmett: I mean, I wouldn't be bothered by two Sanyas.

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:26 PM)*
8ball does Seth put the shirt on real Sanya

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 04:27 PM)*
Spell it with me now, N-O.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:27 PM)*
> Emmett: As long as they don't bully me.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:27 PM)*
> Sanya: No, Garrick. We are not bringing that *thing* with us.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:27 PM)*


*Seth slips the shirt completely off, throwing it over Sanya's head.*

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:27 PM)*


*Emmett proceeded to get to the hatch, waiting on the two.*

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:28 PM)*
> Sanya: "Here you go, sunflower. I think I'm going to go strut your stuff."

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:28 PM)*
> Sanya: I am not letting you leave this ship looking like me.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:29 PM)*


*Emmett tapped his hoof on the ground like Sonic the Hedgehog in his idle animation*

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:29 PM)*
8ball Does Seth start to feel himself in front of Sanya?

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 04:30 PM)*
N0.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:30 PM)*

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:31 PM)*
8ball is Sanya top tier in Final Fighter

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 04:31 PM)*
Outlook bad.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:32 PM)*


*Garrick enters the scene and pulls something out of his pockets to alleviate the situation.*

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:32 PM)*

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:34 PM)*
8ball Does Seth change back into Seth?

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 04:34 PM)*
Yo mama. (Yes).

*That 'something' is the Rubber Chicken.*

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:34 PM)*


*Emmett goes to his room for some trunks.*

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)*

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)*
N Word. (No).

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)*


*Emmett comes back into the den.*

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)*


*In a puff of colored smoke, Seth returned to his male self*

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)*
> Emmett: Garrick, get some swim trunks.

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)*
> Garrick: For what? My legs?

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)*
> Emmett: Your toes.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:36 PM)*
> Sanya: What, are we going swimming?

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:36 PM)*
> Garrick: Gross, they're not toes.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:36 PM)*
> Emmett: Sanya, you and Garrick planned this for me apparently.

**Cooldude** *(16-Jun-20 04:36 PM)*


*Wemmfort pops out of nowhere.*
> Wemmfort: Garrick has toes?

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:36 PM)*


*Emmett points at Garrick's toes.*

**Cooldude** *(16-Jun-20 04:36 PM)*

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:37 PM)*
8ball Does someone knock on the hatch?

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 04:37 PM)*
Nien.

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:37 PM)*

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:37 PM)*
8ball Is Garrick secretly an eldritch god?

YAAAAAS!

**Cooldude** *(16-Jun-20 04:38 PM)*
8ball does Wemmfort suck on Garrick's "toes"?

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 04:38 PM)*
Happy to tell you that it does happen.

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:38 PM)*
That 8ball is retconned because having two gods is OP

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:38 PM)*
> Sanya: Um, Garrick? You have company.

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:39 PM)*


*Wemmfort tries to catch the wispy base in his mouth, but unfortunately fails, because he cannot touch them.*

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:39 PM)*
> Sanya: I'll go see if I have some form of swimsuit.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:39 PM)*


*Sanya walks back to her room.*

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:40 PM)*


*Impatient, Emmett hops atop of Sanya, holding her head. He does so as Sanya enters her room.*

**Cooldude** *(16-Jun-20 04:40 PM)*
> Wemmfort: Toe yum.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:40 PM)*
> Emmett: You're reaaaaaally slow.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:41 PM)*
> Sanya: I have a goat on my head.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:41 PM)*


*Emmett pokes her cheeks.*
> Emmett: Get your clothing, you plant.

**Cooldude** *(16-Jun-20 04:42 PM)*
> Wemmfort: Anyway, what's behind that mask of yours?

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:43 PM)*
> Sanya: I'm not changing with you in the room. There have already been enough of my naked body today.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:43 PM)*
> Emmett: Sanya, are you really that insecure about your nipple-less body?

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:43 PM)*
> Emmett: Or rather, insecure about me seeing it?

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:43 PM)*
> Emmett: You got completely nude while drunk once. I didn't care.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:44 PM)*
> Sanya: What? When was this?

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:45 PM)*
> Emmett: I dunno, like a few semesters ago.

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:45 PM)*


*Garrick exits the living quarters in his 'swimsuit'.*

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:45 PM)*
> Emmett: We were at those heat springs.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:45 PM)*
> Emmett: On Vogega.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:46 PM)*
> Sanya: Whether I've been naked or not doesn't matter. Just get out my room, Emmett.

**Cooldude** *(16-Jun-20 04:46 PM)*


*Wemmfort repeats what he said.*
> Wemmfort: What's behind that mask of yours?

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:46 PM)*
> Garrick: My face.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)*


*Sanya reaches to grab the Squoatling*

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)*
> Garrick: My face is also in front of the mask.

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)*
8ball does Garrick take off his mask, revealing the horror of maskless Garrick to Wemmfort?

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)*
Spell it with me now, Y-E-S.

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)*
> Garrick: Just for you, pal.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:48 PM)*


*Like a sloth, Emmett hangs over her head, pushing his cheek against her flower.*

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:48 PM)*
> Emmett: Nah....

**Cooldude** *(16-Jun-20 04:48 PM)*
It's the truth

**Cooldude** *(16-Jun-20 04:48 PM)*
You can't hide from it

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:49 PM)*
8ball Does maskless Garrick look like Squarrick?

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 04:49 PM)*
No.

**Cooldude** *(16-Jun-20 04:49 PM)*
8ball is maskless Garrick Emmett 2?

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 04:49 PM)*
Outlook bad.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:50 PM)*
8ball Does Sanya forcibly remove Emmett from her room?

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)*
You don't got it.

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)*
8ball does Emmett forcibly remove Sanya from her room?

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)*
Yes, definitely.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)*


*Sanya is pushed out of her room, as the door thuds closed*

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)*
> Sanya: Emmett, what are you doing? Get out of there, I need to change.

> Emmett: Well, Sanya.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:52 PM)*
> Emmett: You see, I need to dress you up.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:52 PM)*
> Emmett: And you won't let me if I'm out of here.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:53 PM)*
> Sanya: I'm changing in your room, then.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:55 PM)*
> Emmett: Here.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:55 PM)*


*Emmett takes some clothes from Sanya's closet. They were pastel colored, potentially Mary's clothing.*

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:55 PM)*
> Emmett: Wear this.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)*
> Sanya: That's... not my swimsuit. Here, it's in the back of the closet.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)*
> Emmett: Sanya.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)*
> Emmett: This is a swimsuit.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)*
> Emmett: Unless you have someone else's clothing in here.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)*
> Emmett: Kinda weird...

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:57 PM)*


*Sanya reaches past and grabs an outfit similar to her daily wear, but without sleeves.*

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:57 PM)*
> Sanya: Those are... Iris'. She must have put them in my closet. I'll give them back to her.

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 04:57 PM)*


*Sanya grabs the clothes from Emmett, stuffing them in her flower.*

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:58 PM)*


*Emmett crosses his arms.*

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:58 PM)*
> Emmett: Alright then.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 04:58 PM)*


*Emmett sat down on her bed, eyeing her.*

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)*
> Sanya: Now, are you going to leave while I change?

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)*
8ball is chomsky black

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)*
Outlook good.

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)*
@Jonas

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)*
@Jonas

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 05:01 PM)*


*Emmett shrugged.*
> Emmett: I need to change too.

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 05:01 PM)*
8ball do they hurry up and change

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 05:01 PM)*
My reply is no.

**Cooldude** *(16-Jun-20 05:01 PM)*
@Jonas

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)*
> Sanya: Just get out of my room.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)*


*Garrick turns into a naked molerat for three seconds.*

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)*
> Garrick: WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING? HURRY UP

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)*
> Emmett: WOW. YOU REALLY WANT US TO HURRY UP?

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)*
> Garrick: ᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀ

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)*


*Emmett races out, tossing his shirt at Garrick.*

**Cooldude** *(16-Jun-20 05:03 PM)*


*Trey screams in final frontier*

**Brody** *(16-Jun-20 05:03 PM)*


*Sanya locks the door behind Emmett, getting dressed.*

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 05:03 PM)*


*Garrick catches the shirt and throws it back, starting a game of catch.*

**Cooldude** *(16-Jun-20 05:04 PM)*
Sanya's boobies look like this
(edited)

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)*


*Emmett catches the shirt and takes off his sweatpants. He tosses both back and puts on his trunks.*

**Jonas** *(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)*
Chomsky is not black

**Jonas** *(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)*
Sorry to tell you trey

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)*
White face

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)*
Is he going on the beach trip with everyone else

**Cooldude** *(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)*
Chomsky is in fact, yellow
(edited)

**Jonas** *(16-Jun-20 05:06 PM)*
To be honest with you trey I'm not sure hes there at all
I only came in for 1 episode at the very beginning

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 05:06 PM)*
Is that why Garrick has a picture of his butt with sunglasses on it

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 05:06 PM)*
As memorabilia

**Jonas** *(16-Jun-20 05:06 PM)*
Sure

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 05:07 PM)*
He's stayed

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 05:07 PM)*
Just in the backlines until you one day pick him up

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 05:07 PM)*
And eat him

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 05:07 PM)*
And absorb

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)*
8ball are Chomsky and Mary related

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)*
No, but something that the person after you decides upon happens.

**Trey** *(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)*
8ball says so

**Cooldude** *(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)*
8poop

**FFBot** *(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)*
No, you are poop.

**Zander** *(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)*
They're brother and sister
