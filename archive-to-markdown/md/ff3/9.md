**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:20 PM)_

_Emmett gets to the cockpit and speaks to the security over the ship's comms._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:20 PM)_

> Emmett: We're safe. We have tickets. Please don't turn us into American Dad characters.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:20 PM)_

> Emmett: "You're in the clear. Park over in section I-66."

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:20 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett park the ship in section I-66?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_
Ja.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_

> Emmett: Cool.

_Emmett gets back into the den, waiting for the others._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_

> Emmett: SANYA, GARRICK.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_

> Emmett: (others)

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:21 PM)_

> Emmett: Get in here.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:22 PM)_

_Sanya walks out of her room, walking to the den_

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Sanya: What is it, Emmett?

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: You have a doppelganger.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_
8ball Does Seth flash Sanya?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_
You decide. You earned it!

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_

_Emmett looks over to the nippled Sanya and sweats a little._

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:24 PM)_

> Sanya: "You're pretty hot, sunflower!"

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth, why?

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_

_Sanya does a double take at the doppleganger_

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:25 PM)_

> Sanya: "Because I can. Plus, Tits."

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

> Garrick: Are we bringing two Sanyas with us?

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

> Sanya: If you don't put my shirt back on, i'll show you how it feels to be stabbed as a woman.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

> Emmett: I mean, I wouldn't be bothered by two Sanyas.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_
8ball does Seth put the shirt on real Sanya

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_
Spell it with me now, N-O.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Emmett: As long as they don't bully me.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Sanya: No, Garrick. We are not bringing that _thing_ with us.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

_Seth slips the shirt completely off, throwing it over Sanya's head._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

_Emmett proceeded to get to the hatch, waiting on the two._

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_

> Sanya: "Here you go, sunflower. I think I'm going to go strut your stuff."

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_

> Sanya: I am not letting you leave this ship looking like me.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_

_Emmett tapped his hoof on the ground like Sonic the Hedgehog in his idle animation_

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_
8ball Does Seth start to feel himself in front of Sanya?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_
N0.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

> Sanya: Put the shirt on. Now.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_
8ball is Sanya top tier in Final Fighter

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_
Outlook bad.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

_Garrick enters the scene and pulls something out of his pockets to alleviate the situation._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

> Emmett: SANYA(s).

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

> Emmett: PLEASE. I WANT TO VACATION.

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:33 PM)_

> Wemmfort: SANYA PARENTHESIS S PARENTHESIS.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:33 PM)_

> Sanya: I am not leaving until Seth changes!

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

_Emmett leans against the hatch._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

> Emmett: Actually.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_
8ball Does Seth change back into Seth?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_
Yo mama. (Yes).

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

_That 'something' is the Rubber Chicken._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

_Emmett goes to his room for some trunks._

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Garrick: "HONK"

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_
8ball is wemmfort's translator broken?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_
N Word. (No).

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

_Emmett comes back into the den._

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

_In a puff of colored smoke, Seth returned to his male self_

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: Garrick, get some swim trunks.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Garrick: For what? My legs?

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: Your toes.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Sanya: What, are we going swimming?

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Garrick: Gross, they're not toes.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, you and Garrick planned this for me apparently.

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

_Wemmfort pops out of nowhere._

> Wemmfort: Garrick has toes?

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

_Emmett points at Garrick's toes._

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I see.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Garrick: Not toes.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_
8ball Does someone knock on the hatch?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_
Nien.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

_Garrick goes to change into a more tropical-looking vest._

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_
8ball Is Garrick secretly an eldritch god?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_
YAAAAAS!

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_
8ball does Wemmfort suck on Garrick's "toes"?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_
Happy to tell you that it does happen.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_
That 8ball is retconned because having two gods is OP

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_

> Sanya: Um, Garrick? You have company.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

_Wemmfort tries to catch the wispy base in his mouth, but unfortunately fails, because he cannot touch them._

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll go see if I have some form of swimsuit.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:39 PM)_

_Sanya walks back to her room._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

_Impatient, Emmett hops atop of Sanya, holding her head. He does so as Sanya enters her room._

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Toe yum.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:40 PM)_

> Emmett: You're reaaaaaally slow.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:41 PM)_

> Sanya: I have a goat on my head.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:41 PM)_

_Emmett pokes her cheeks._

> Emmett: Get your clothing, you plant.

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:42 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Anyway, what's behind that mask of yours?

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:43 PM)_

> Sanya: I'm not changing with you in the room. There have already been enough of my naked body today.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:43 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, are you really that insecure about your nipple-less body?

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:43 PM)_

> Emmett: Or rather, insecure about me seeing it?

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:43 PM)_

> Emmett: You got completely nude while drunk once. I didn't care.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:44 PM)_

> Sanya: What? When was this?

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:45 PM)_

> Emmett: I dunno, like a few semesters ago.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:45 PM)_

_Garrick exits the living quarters in his 'swimsuit'._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:45 PM)_

> Emmett: We were at those heat springs.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:45 PM)_

> Emmett: On Vogega.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:46 PM)_

> Sanya: Whether I've been naked or not doesn't matter. Just get out my room, Emmett.

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:46 PM)_

_Wemmfort repeats what he said._

> Wemmfort: What's behind that mask of yours?

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:46 PM)_

> Garrick: My face.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_

_Sanya reaches to grab the Squoatling_

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_

> Garrick: My face is also in front of the mask.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_
8ball does Garrick take off his mask, revealing the horror of maskless Garrick to Wemmfort?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_
Spell it with me now, Y-E-S.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_

> Garrick: Just for you, pal.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:48 PM)_

_Like a sloth, Emmett hangs over her head, pushing his cheek against her flower._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:48 PM)_

> Emmett: Nah....

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:48 PM)_
It's the truth

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:48 PM)_
You can't hide from it

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:49 PM)_
8ball Does maskless Garrick look like Squarrick?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:49 PM)_
No.

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 04:49 PM)_
8ball is maskless Garrick Emmett 2?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:49 PM)_
Outlook bad.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:50 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya forcibly remove Emmett from her room?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)_
You don't got it.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)_
8ball does Emmett forcibly remove Sanya from her room?

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)_
Yes, definitely.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)_

_Sanya is pushed out of her room, as the door thuds closed_

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:51 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett, what are you doing? Get out of there, I need to change.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:52 PM)_

> Emmett: Well, Sanya.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:52 PM)_

> Emmett: You see, I need to dress you up.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:52 PM)_

> Emmett: And you won't let me if I'm out of here.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:53 PM)_

> Sanya: I'm changing in your room, then.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:55 PM)_

> Emmett: Here.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:55 PM)_

_Emmett takes some clothes from Sanya's closet. They were pastel colored, potentially Mary's clothing._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:55 PM)_

> Emmett: Wear this.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

> Sanya: That's... not my swimsuit. Here, it's in the back of the closet.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

> Emmett: This is a swimsuit.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

> Emmett: Unless you have someone else's clothing in here.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

> Emmett: Kinda weird...

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:57 PM)_

_Sanya reaches past and grabs an outfit similar to her daily wear, but without sleeves._

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:57 PM)_

> Sanya: Those are... Iris'. She must have put them in my closet. I'll give them back to her.

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 04:57 PM)_

_Sanya grabs the clothes from Emmett, stuffing them in her flower._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:58 PM)_

_Emmett crosses his arms._

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:58 PM)_

> Emmett: Alright then.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 04:58 PM)_

_Emmett sat down on her bed, eyeing her._

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_

> Sanya: Now, are you going to leave while I change?

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_
8ball is chomsky black

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_
Outlook good.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_
@Jonas

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_
@Jonas

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_

_Emmett shrugged._

> Emmett: I need to change too.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_
8ball do they hurry up and change

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_
My reply is no.

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_
@Jonas

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

> Sanya: Just get out of my room.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

_Garrick turns into a naked molerat for three seconds._

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

> Garrick: WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING? HURRY UP

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

> Emmett: WOW. YOU REALLY WANT US TO HURRY UP?

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

> Garrick: ᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀᴀ

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

_Emmett races out, tossing his shirt at Garrick._

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 05:03 PM)_

_Trey screams in final frontier_

**Brody** _(16-Jun-20 05:03 PM)_

_Sanya locks the door behind Emmett, getting dressed._

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:03 PM)_

_Garrick catches the shirt and throws it back, starting a game of catch._

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 05:04 PM)_
Sanya's boobies look like this
(edited)

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

_Emmett catches the shirt and takes off his sweatpants. He tosses both back and puts on his trunks._

**Jonas** _(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_
Chomsky is not black

**Jonas** _(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_
Sorry to tell you trey

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_
White face

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_
Is he going on the beach trip with everyone else

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_
Chomsky is in fact, yellow
(edited)

**Jonas** _(16-Jun-20 05:06 PM)_
To be honest with you trey I'm not sure hes there at all
I only came in for 1 episode at the very beginning

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:06 PM)_
Is that why Garrick has a picture of his butt with sunglasses on it

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:06 PM)_
As memorabilia

**Jonas** _(16-Jun-20 05:06 PM)_
Sure

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_
He's stayed

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_
Just in the backlines until you one day pick him up

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_
And eat him

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_
And absorb

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_
8ball are Chomsky and Mary related

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_
No, but something that the person after you decides upon happens.

**Trey** _(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_
8ball says so

**Cooldude** _(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_
8poop

**FFBot** _(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_
No, you are poop.

**Zander** _(16-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_
They're brother and sister
