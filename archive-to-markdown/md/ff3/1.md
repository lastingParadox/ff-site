**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:05 PM)_

> Emmett: Even if I just started it.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:06 PM)_

_D: This could be useful, though..._

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:06 PM)_
8ball does Wes trip Sanya with his tail and quick-draw his pistol, aiming it at Emmett?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:06 PM)_
Concentrate and ask again.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:06 PM)_
8ball does Wes trip Sanya with his tail and quick-draw his pistol, aiming it at Emmett?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:06 PM)_
Yes, definitely.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:06 PM)_

_Seth starts to head in the direction of Emmett_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:06 PM)_

> Iris: I dont know.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:06 PM)_

> Emmett: I wonder where this little bread-crumb trail goes.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:06 PM)_

> Wes: You're worth a lot of money, you know.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:06 PM)_

> Seth: I need SMOKE

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:06 PM)_

_Emmett shrugged._

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:06 PM)_

_Sanya falls to the floor_

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:06 PM)_

_D: Not the most graceful._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:07 PM)_

> Emmett: Kill me. Be the root cause of an entire species being erradicated.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:07 PM)_

_Wes steps on sanya, keeping her on the floor._

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:07 PM)_

> Dakari: I could use some moving target practice. Just saying...

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:07 PM)_

> Sanya: If you touch him, you die.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:07 PM)_

_The croissant walks to Iris and sits on here, making a happy noise._

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:07 PM)_

> Seth: I am in need of SMOKES EMMETT I AM COMING TO KILL YOU

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:07 PM)_

> Sanya: I promise you, your scales will make a perfect trophy

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:08 PM)_

> Dakari: Well I don't think it should just wander freely at least.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:08 PM)_

> Wes: How about we just co-operate for a bit. And you, how about you shut your goddamn mouth and photosynthesize or something.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:08 PM)_

> Iris: Probably not.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:08 PM)_
8ball Does Seth arrive from behind Emmett?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:08 PM)_
I think so.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:08 PM)_

> Seth: IT IS TIME

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:08 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth, come on.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:08 PM)_

> Seth: THE TIME HAS COME

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:08 PM)_

> Seth: THE TIME HAS COME

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:08 PM)_

> Seth: THE TIME HAS COME

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:08 PM)_

_Emmett looks behind._

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:08 PM)_

_Iris thinks for a moment before tying the end of one of her ribbons around it._

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:08 PM)_

_D: This should be very interesting._

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:09 PM)_

_Seth grabs a metal pipe and starts flailing it around_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:09 PM)_

> Emmett: There's lite- FUCK OFF!

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:09 PM)_

> Seth: THE TIME HAS COME

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:09 PM)_

> Sanya: Now, meet our captain.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:09 PM)_
8ball does garrick leave the ship after waking up and join the commotion

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:09 PM)_
Sing the poopy farty song word for word. The others will decide your fate.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:09 PM)_

_Seth throws the metal pipe into the air_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:09 PM)_

> Seth: Did you get my smokes?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:09 PM)_

_Emmett ducks, trying to reason with the towering figure._

> Emmett: There's literally a cigar stand up there.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:09 PM)_

> Wes: Your captain seems a bit hostile.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:10 PM)_

> Iris: This... works.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:10 PM)_

> Seth: I wonder if they have Elf Tobacco

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:10 PM)_

_Sanya starts laughing_

> Sanya: You don't know the half of it.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:10 PM)_

_The croissant chirps happily???_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:10 PM)_

> Seth: Who's that?

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:10 PM)_

> Garrick: This guy got a problem?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:10 PM)_

> Seth: Isn't that the guy from the big TV

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:10 PM)_

> Sanya: Get this asshole off of me before he dies.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:10 PM)_

> Seth: Who are you again?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_

> Emmett: Now...

_Emmett got back in his position, pushing Wes's arm up to where it was originally._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_

> Emmett: Back in action.

_Emmett winks._

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_

_Wes shoots the ground next to Sanya's face._

> Wes: Why, I'm the greatest racer and deadshot of all time.

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_

> Dakari: If this croissant is alive... what about the other ones?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_

> Seth: Not you faggot

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_
8ball does the croissant get up and run away

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_
Concentrate and ask again.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_

_Garrick blindly grabs a weapon from his pocket in preparation for a fight._

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_

> Seth: The plant lady

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, you asshole.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_
8ball does the croissant get up and run away

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_
Concentrate and ask again.

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_

> Dakari: The whole throne of them?

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_

> Iris: Probably not.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_

> Seth: You don't know the half of it babes

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_

> Dakari: I hope not.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_
8ball does the croissant get up and run away

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:11 PM)_
No. In fact, the opposite happens.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:12 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya produce fear gas?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:12 PM)_
I think so.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:12 PM)_

> Emmett: Come on man.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:12 PM)_

_The croissant dives into Iris' stomach._

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:12 PM)_

> Sanya: Eat shit, deadshot.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:12 PM)_

> Emmett: You're not going to kill me.

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:12 PM)_

> Dakari: Uh...

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:12 PM)_

> Emmett: And I'm not going to hurt you.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:12 PM)_

> Wes: what is that, poison gas? Come on, I'm wearing a custom helmet.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:12 PM)_

> Sanya: But I will.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:13 PM)_
So is the croissant a duck?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:13 PM)_

> Emmett: But, uh... You've got nowhere to go.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:13 PM)_

> Wes: I'd like it if you could shut your little bonsai up so we can cooperate.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:13 PM)_

_Emmett was hoping someone in the crew would explode Wes's ship at that moment._

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:13 PM)_

> Sanya: It's not poison, dipshit. It's pure fear, in gas form. And i promise you, no helmet will help.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:13 PM)_

> Garrick: Okay guys, I know we said no more crimes, but we could just knock him out and take him with us.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Sanya: And i am NOT

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_
8ball did wes leave his oven on so his ship catches on fire

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_
Without a doubt.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Sanya: some PLANT!

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Chomsky: that sucks

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

_the croissant runs towards the storage room_

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Chomsky: guys uh, that ship...

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, can you please not send your pheromones over to our friend here?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't think he wants to fornicate.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Seth: Oh, Sanya!

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

_BOOOOOM_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Seth: Thats your name

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Chomsky: hey newbie, that yours?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:14 PM)_

> Seth: I remember you.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

_Noticing the explosion, Wes is devastated._

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

> Wes: FUCK!

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

> Seth: Haha, ship go boomie

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

_Sanya takes this time to flip over the lizard and pin him to the ground_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

_Emmett holds his hoof out._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

> Garrick: Nowhere to run, TV guy.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

_Wes kicks Sanya in the chest while sprinting towards his beloved ship_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

> Emmett: Want to be even mor-

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

_Iris follows the croissant._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:15 PM)_

_Emmett chases Wes intently_

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, you bitch.

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)_

> Chomsky: i know im the fire guy, but i swear i didnt light anything on fire this time.

_chomsky follows wes as well_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)_

_Seth draws his laser rifle and sets it to stun as he follows the two_

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)_

> Chomsky: I KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH FIRES DONT WORRY

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)_

> Garrick: Don't stop it!

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)_

_the croissant enters through a slightly open door, making a startled squeak moments later_

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:16 PM)_

_Sanya races after Wes_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

_Iris dives in- she's a little attached to the croissant._

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

_Arriving at the ship in shambles, Wes falls to his knees._

> Wes: Oh, come on, that was my favorite raceship!

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

_it's pitch black inside_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_
8ball did the croissant fall off to reveal a duck?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_
Yes, definitely.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

_Emmett starts panting._

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

> Iris: Duck!

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm not in shape.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

_with the only light being a singular green dot in the back corner and the small patch from the door_

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

> Chomsky: geez, what a burn. what happened to make it go up that suddenly?

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

_Sanya catches up and draws her word_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:17 PM)_

> Emmett: I thought those were rats. Color me surprised.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

> Sanya: Word

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

> Garrick: THATS RACIST

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

_the duck runs away hiding in the dark_

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

_Sanya then draws her sword_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

> Emmett: I was offering you a chance at redemption, Wes.
> 8ball Do I go towards the duck to pick it up?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_
The person who goes after you decides.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

> Emmett: I know your scandals.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

_Iris hurries into the dark after the duckling._

> Iris: Come back! Blueberry!

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

> Wes: It was custom made to move as fast as possible. The engine was almost completely exposed.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:18 PM)_

> Emmett: Your steroids.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Wes: My what now? I race ships, not people.

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Chomsky: dont you know how to build a ship?! the ENGINE was exposed?!

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Emmett: What's up with your jacked up arms?

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Wes: It was supposed to allow the vaccuum of space to cool it down!

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_
Yes

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Wes: The hell are you on about?

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Sanya: Skip the formalities and just kill him.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Emmett: Look at your fucking arms!

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:19 PM)_

> Wes: Let a lizard grieve, man. This thing was like a son to me.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

_The door closes and locks behind the two_

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Burner: Drop him

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Chomsky: arent you rich? cant you buy a new identical ship?

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

_Iris yelps, not liking that she can't see anything anymore._

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_
8ball Does Dakari search in his newly bought couch and find ducketts?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_
No.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Wes: What do you mean!? My arms??

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Emmett: Woah woah woah.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_
8ball does Seth aim and stun Sanya, Emmett, and Wes?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_
As I see it, yes.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Iris: Blueberry??

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

_The fear gas is kicking in._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Emmett: Lets take it easy here. Who's talking?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Seth: Ah peace and quiet

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:20 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett, just shut up. Either recruit him or kill him.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

_Emmett has a small seizure_

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Sanya: I Sw-

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Seth: Alright Garrick, help me get them into the ship

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Garrick: Let's hold him for ransom. He's famous, isn't he?

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Garrick: Gotcha.

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Chomsky: hey i'd like a famous person in our crew. maybe he can do something about emmetts bounty.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Wes: My...arms...?

_Wes watches as his arms begin melting in front of him. He is then knocked back into reality as he is stunned._

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Burner: Diver you absolute shithead

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:21 PM)_

> Burner: what were you thinking

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_

_Seth starts dragging Wes, Emmett, and Sanya into the ship_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_

> Iris: I'm Iris, give me the duck.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_

> Seth: Emmett, stop squirming.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_

> Burner: Who are you.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_

> Emmett: Clearly this is more intricate than you simply wanting the Duck.
> 8ball Does Emmett, once he's unstunned, buck the shit out of Seth, literally making a poop stain on the floor?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_
Group vote. Vote in the order from first player down to last. Majority opinion wins. No changing answers.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_
8ball does Garrick successfully possess Wes

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_
Most likely.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:22 PM)_

> Iris: Iris.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

_Seth turns on his comms_

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Good news, guys! He's weak, so I can get him on the ship!

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Emmett: I was asking the voice of which I cannot see its owner.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Wes: Why am I moving

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

_Garrick-Wes walks shakily over to the ship._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Emmett: Shhh.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Sorry, I haven't had legs in a while.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Wes: What

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Seth: I need help, we got people we need to get on the ship, aka Emmett and Sanya.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Burner: You're both going to stay quiet.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Emmett: We're getting put up for ransom.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:23 PM)_

> Wes: Why is there a voice inside my head

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Emmett: And why should I listen to your demands?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Seth: Garrick, put him in the hold.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

_D: Hey Ghost, can you tell the Elf to stop dragging us so harshly?_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Iris: Why?

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Garrick: I'm your conscience. You should go with them.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Wes: ...

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Burner: Diver come here, we need to leave.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Wes: I guess I was the instigator..

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Emmett: You still haven't made clear who you are.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Garrick: Hey Seth... the flower says stop dragging them so harshly.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Emmett: Other than the fact that one of you is a duck.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Seth: I'll try.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

_Garrick-Wes makes it to the ship._

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Burner: And it's best that it stays that way

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Emmett: Yeah, sure.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Iris: I'm not a duck.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

_Emmett's tongue hangs out of his mouth and his mouth begins to foam a little._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:24 PM)_

> Garrick: Seth! Grab him!

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

_D: Tell him thank you._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Emmett: We both know how this ends if you try and sneak off.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Wes: Well, I guess I could use a ride, now that my ship is fucked.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't know this crew, but most seem rather batshit.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Garrick: Also, flower says thanks.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

_Seth starts kicking Emmett_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Seth: Stop squirming.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Emmett: I think it's best you stick with me.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Burner: Is that so?

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Iris: Wow- that's a little rude?

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Chomsky: aight, you guys look like you have the...possessing handled. I'm headin back to my room

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm sorry, Cooking Mama.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

> Garrick: I can't hold on for very long, can someone grab this guy??

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:25 PM)_

_Seth arrives at the ship and tosses the two into the ship_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Allow me to extend my more serious apologies.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Burner: I disagree. It's best the two of us leave and you two stay here for a minute.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Wes: Wait, why is my conscience speaking about me in the third person?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Seth: Alright, chums, lets get out of here.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Well I am going to bring up a counterclaim.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Garrick: Don't worry about it...

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: You'd rather a former GSS on your side than against you.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Garrick: Oooooo....

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Trust me.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

_Low growling is heard from the corner with the small green light_

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

_Garrick splits from Wes and knocks him out._

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:26 PM)_

> Iris: I only bake when I'm stressed.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

_D: Tell the lizard that i admire his fighting spirit._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth, you had the voltage way to high!

_Emmett's voice was almost incomprehensible._

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Wes: Could you guys take me to my personal mechanic? I need to get a new S-

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Iris: Ookay, creepy noise- getting a little stressed now.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Seth: What?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Emmett: Your will is weak.

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Wes: I'm...ti..red..

**Jonas** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_
not gay

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Iris: Yeah it is, what of it?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

_Seth starts up the auto-pilot_

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

_Wes collapses on one of the couches, taking up the whole thing._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Emmett: That's the main difference between you and I.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

> Seth: Alright, we're leaving.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:27 PM)_

_a quack responds from by the door_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_

> Seth: Hope you guys had everything.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_

> Iris: Blueberry!

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_

_Iris heads towards the quack._

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_

_D: Well, this is interesting. I do want to try something, though..._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't believe for a shred that's its name.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_
8ball is Emmett unstunned?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_
My sources say no.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:28 PM)_

> Garrick: Hey flower.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Iris: Well what do you want me to do, ask the duck?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett: Yes.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_
8ball Does Dread possess Sanya's stunned body?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_
No.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett: It talks.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

_the growling continues_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Seth: HEY, we're launching.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Garrick: If I ate you, would I inherit dread fear power?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Seth: Steel yourselves.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Iris: Well how was I supposed to know that exactly?

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Burner: It's Diver his name is diver

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

_D: No._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Garrick: What if I stuck you in my pocket?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett: You've yet to tell me yours.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

> Iris: Okay.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

> Emmett: I feel like we're on a First-Name basis by now.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

_D: You'd have to put Sanya in your pocket, too._

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

_Iris walks over, hoping to pick up Diver._

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

> Burner: Mine doesn't matter, however diver seems to stay. what did you do?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

> Emmett: Would you leave the duck the fuck alone?

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

_D: What if i ate you? What would that do?_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

> Emmett: I beg your pardon?

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:30 PM)_

> Iris: Would you fuck off?

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)_

> Garrick: How would you manage that?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)_

_Emmett finally stopped squirming._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)_

> Garrick: But hey, I can put Sanya in my pocket.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)_

> Iris: I dunno, he just came out of a croissant I baked and he seemed to like me.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)_

_The flower opens its eye-mouth_

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:31 PM)_

> Seth: Oh good we can launch.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

_D: Like this._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Emmett: Can you not stun me?

_Emmett's voice was getting more understandable._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Garrick: Does that imply that you, in your physical form, can interact with spectres?

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Garrick: That's wack.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Seth: You were a bit too hostile

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Burner: Of course it was bread involved. that's low.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Seth: I just solved that.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

_D: I was a god._

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Seth: Plus you forgot my smokes

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Garrick: Keyword: was. You're a flower now.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_
8ball does Iris pick up Diver?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_
Flip a coin with 8coin. Heads is yes, tails is no.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:32 PM)_

> Garrick: Bound to a Floran.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_
8coin

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_
Heads.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_

_D: and you don't have legs, what about it?_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_

_Iris is holding Diver now._

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_

_Diver quacks unhappily_

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_

> Garrick: Movement is easier without legs.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_

> Emmett: I do not associate with her.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:33 PM)_

> Burner: Drop him. I'm not asking nicely

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)_

_Noting his displeasure, Iris puts him down._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)_
8ball do I find a secret light switch and flood the room with light?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)_
Yes, definitely.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)_

> Iris: I'm not an asshole, I won't hold him if he doesn't want me to.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)_

> Emmett: Aha!

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:34 PM)_

> Emmett: So you're both ducks, apparently.

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:35 PM)_
8ball Does Dakari search through his new couch and find ducketts?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:35 PM)_
I think so.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:35 PM)_

> Burner: Finally. I was wondering how long it would take one of you to think of a light switch

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:35 PM)_

_Garrick reclines on one of the new couches._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:35 PM)_

> Emmett: Sorry, I was trying to do the talking.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:35 PM)_

_Iris glares at Mateo. Her impression of him thus far is that he's a jerk._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:35 PM)_

> Garrick: At least we have somewhere for the new guy to sleep.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:35 PM)_
8ball Does Seth and Emmett launch the ship?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:35 PM)_
The person who went before you can decide.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:35 PM)_

> Emmett: Don't look at me like that.

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:36 PM)_
Yes

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:36 PM)_

> Iris: I won't glare if you don't insult me.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:36 PM)_

_D: Can someone move Sanya to her room? The floor is cold._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: That's what you get for stunning me.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:36 PM)_

> Seth: Asshole

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:36 PM)_

> Emmett: You're making it difficult not to.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:36 PM)_

_Burner, knowing the gig is up, grabs Diver's vest with her beak and drags him out the door_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:37 PM)_

> Emmett: Excuse me, where do you think you're going?

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:37 PM)_
t!choose 100 ducketts | 1,000 ducketts | 10,000 ducketts

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:37 PM)_
🤔 | Platinum_Pathos, I pick 10,000 ducketts

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:37 PM)_

_Emmett rubs his nipples mockingly, given that he hasn't had a shirt on the whole time._

**Silas** _(22-Apr-20 05:37 PM)_

_Wes begins to snore and talk in his sleep._

> Wes: ....I'm the greatest.....

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:37 PM)_

> Seth: Fag.

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:37 PM)_

> Dakari: Awesome, time to stash this.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:37 PM)_

_Iris exits the storage room, not seeing a reason to be present within it anymore._

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:37 PM)_

> Burner: Off this ship. we can't stay here now.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:37 PM)_

> Iris: Huh? Why not?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:37 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't think you have a choice.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:38 PM)_

_D: I deserve to be treated better than this._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:38 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett get into the living room, noticing the couch?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:38 PM)_
Group vote. Vote in the order from first player down to last. Minority opinion wins. No changing answers.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:38 PM)_

> Burner: Wait, did it launch already?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:38 PM)_

> Emmett: Um, yes.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:38 PM)_
8ball does Garrick fit all of Sanya in his pockets?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:38 PM)_
As I see it, yes.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:38 PM)_

> Emmett: You got a new couch, Dakari?

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:38 PM)_

> Garrick: Here you go.

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:38 PM)_

> Dakari: Yea, someone had to.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:38 PM)_

_Garrick enters Sanya's room through the wall._

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

> Seth: I'll be in my room if you need me.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

> Emmett: But it looks like it can only fit you.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

_The second duck begins cursing and thrashing in the middle of the hall_

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

_D: Oh, you bitch. When she wakes up, she will be so pissed._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

> Garrick: What's it like in there?

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

_D: Fuck you._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

> Emmett: Doesn't help to throw a fit.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

_Iris blinks._

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

> Dakari: Well, I suppose it could also be used as a chair for the rest of you.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

_Emmett holds out his hand in an attempt to trip whomever is causing all of the ruckus (The second duck)_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:39 PM)_

> Iris: Are you... okay?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:40 PM)_
(Given that it's a duck, the duck would be scooped up instead of tripped.)

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:40 PM)_

_D: Wait a minute... i have an idea..._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:40 PM)_

_Garrick reaches his hand in his pocket, trying to grab Sanya._

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:40 PM)_

_The second duck brings Diver back onto the nest he made_

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:40 PM)_
t!choose sanya | chomsky's old journal | croissant | a different flower

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:40 PM)_
🤔 | [RP]retribution, I pick sanya

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:41 PM)_

> Garrick: There we are.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:41 PM)_

_Garrick drops Sanya on her bed._

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:41 PM)_

_D: Wait, stay here a second._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:41 PM)_

> Garrick: That sounds threatening.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:41 PM)_
8ball do the ducks successfully retreat to the storage room?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:41 PM)_
You may rely on it.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:41 PM)_

_D: I have an idea_

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:41 PM)_

> Dakari: So, are some of us stuck living out here in the living room for a while Emmett?

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:42 PM)_
8ball Are Dread's and Garrick's pocket dimensions connected?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:42 PM)_
As I see it, yes.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:42 PM)_

> Emmett: Huh. And yeah... Well, we're going to have to share rooms while we get the expansion made.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:42 PM)_

_D:Huh._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:42 PM)_

> Garrick: I sense a disturbance.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:42 PM)_

_Iris pokes her head into the storage room._

> Iris: Hey, what do you two want for dinner?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:42 PM)_

_Emmett tapped into the intercom through his comms._

> Emmett: HEY. WE NEED TO SETTLE ROOM SHARING.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:43 PM)_

> Garrick: I'm locking that door from my side...

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:43 PM)_

_D: Hey, put something in my mouth and try to pull it out from your belt._

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:43 PM)_
Better not tell you now.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:43 PM)_

_Diver quacks happily from the center of his makeshift nest_

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:43 PM)_

_D: C'mon, try it._

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:43 PM)_

> Seth: You know the rules Emmett, I get my own room.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:43 PM)_
8ball Is Seth's Magic Satchel Connected with Dread's and Garrick's, but are they separated by a border control?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:43 PM)_
Cannot predict now.

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:43 PM)_
8ball Is Seth's Magic Satchel Connected with Dread's and Garrick's, but are they separated by a border control?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:43 PM)_
As I see it, yes.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:44 PM)_

_Garrick locks the door from his side._

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:44 PM)_

> Burner: We have our own dinner

_The second duck points to the nest where cinnamon sticks and bread strands are woven in_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:44 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm going to tell them you're here.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:44 PM)_

> Garrick: Problem solved.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:44 PM)_

> Emmett: Don't live in secrecy.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:44 PM)_

> Burner: It would be better if you don't

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:44 PM)_

_Iris nods, turning to Mateo._

> Iris: You?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:45 PM)_

> Emmett: Alright, so we have five rooms...
> Emmett: If worst comes to worst, I've got your back.
> Emmett: I'll say Garrick and Chomsky are together...
> Emmett: Sanya and Iris?

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:45 PM)_

_Iris speaks into the comms._

> Iris: Hey Sanya can I room with you?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:45 PM)_

> Emmett: And then Dakari and I are together.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:45 PM)_

_D: Ghost, tell her Sanya's still out._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:45 PM)_

> Garrick: IRIS.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:45 PM)_

> Burner: Thanks shifter. But I think we'll be fine

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

> Iris: Yelllo?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

> Emmett: Um, how did you know?

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

> Garrick: Dreadflower says you suck and Sanya hates you.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

> Emmett: Now, if you excuse me, I got a ruckus to make.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

> Iris: :(

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

_Seth falls asleep_

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

> Dakari: Go on ahead.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett run into Sanya's room and hop atop of her?

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_
No. In fact, the opposite happens.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

_D: why does anyone like you, ghost?_

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

_Iris makes a sad noise._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

> Garrick: I'm not your little messenger ghost.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

> Emmett: WAKE UP.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

> Garrick: Get Sanya to do your bidding.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

> Sanya: eugh

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

> Emmett: PLANT.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:46 PM)_

> Sanya: What?

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:47 PM)_

> Garrick: Rise and shine.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:47 PM)_

> Iris: Sanya, Garrick said you hate me.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:47 PM)_

_The duck's vest produces a green eyepiece that produces a familiar green light_

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:47 PM)_

> Emmett: Why are you atop of me?

**Sean** _(22-Apr-20 05:47 PM)_

_Seth remotely locks his door_

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:47 PM)_

> Sanya: I...

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:47 PM)_

> Sanya: i don't know.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:47 PM)_

> Emmett: That's some high-tech piece you got there.

_Emmett just chilled there._

> Emmett: What model was that again?
> Emmett: Kinda weird.

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:48 PM)_

> Burner: Custom.

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:48 PM)_

_Sanya startes walking to her room._

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:48 PM)_

> Garrick: What was that about?

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:48 PM)_

> Emmett: Very interesting.
> Emmett: Dakari, come over here. There's a bed for you.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:48 PM)_

_Iris sighs in disappointment, thinking that was directed at her, but nods._

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:48 PM)_

> Emmett: Could've sworn the GSS gave us similar models.
> Emmett: Mateo and Wes will be bedbuddies or whatever.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:48 PM)_

> Iris: Okay. I'll take the couch.

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:48 PM)_

_Iris goes and jumps on top of Emmett, wounding him._

**Brody** _(22-Apr-20 05:49 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, and don't believe that ghost. Here, if you need a room, you can share mine.

**Rashidi** _(22-Apr-20 05:49 PM)_

_Dakari follows Emmett_

**Bill** _(22-Apr-20 05:49 PM)_

> Burner: I take it you don't know much about high end security

**Trey** _(22-Apr-20 05:49 PM)_
8ball does Iris go and jump on Emmett

**FFBot** _(22-Apr-20 05:49 PM)_
Ask Emmett.

**Zander** _(22-Apr-20 05:49 PM)_
Sure

> Emmett: My boys did Guerilla shit.

**Lili** _(22-Apr-20 05:49 PM)_

> Iris: Sorry- what do you want for dinner?
