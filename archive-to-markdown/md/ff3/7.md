**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:26 PM)_
8ball Did someone notify Sanya of the plan?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 03:26 PM)_
Yes moment.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:26 PM)_

> Emmett: Alright, guys.

_Emmett rotates in his swivel chair, away from his holodevice._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:26 PM)_

_Sanya finally woke up from her 72-hour nap in a flower pot._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:26 PM)_

> Vargas: Hello? Anyone there?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:26 PM)_

> Sanya: So, what's the rest of the plan?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:27 PM)_

_"I needed my beauty sleep", she said._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:27 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't know. I just know that I need a suit fast.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:27 PM)_

> Vargas: I need my plostacian!!

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:28 PM)_

> Emmett: And also...

_Emmett ignored the screaming man._

> Emmett: We're getting more Ducketts from this. Roughly 75,000 more.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:28 PM)_

> Vargas: HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!?!

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:28 PM)_

> Sanya: You're going in there with the only plan being: "Im a distraction?"

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:28 PM)_

> Volentina: Quiet down man, I like my ears

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:29 PM)_

> Emmett: Yeah. I'm a Squoatling.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:29 PM)_

> Emmett: When push comes to shove, I'll take off my helmet.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:29 PM)_

> Vargas: I can heaaaar you.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:29 PM)_

> Sanya: Ok, what happens then?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:29 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't know. I'm just having a quaint dinner with a Llamanian.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:29 PM)_

> Volentina: And what happens if it goes really south really fast?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:30 PM)_

> Emmett: If it goes really south...

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:30 PM)_

> Sanya: Wait, when did you become a girl?

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:30 PM)_

> Volentina: Last night

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:30 PM)_

> Vargas: Hey i can be bait for some plostacian.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:30 PM)_
8ball did Emmett tell Sanya and Garrick about his Llamanian encounter?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 03:30 PM)_
Yes, but in a monotonous tone.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:31 PM)_

_Garrick emerges from the wall._

> Garrick: I feel like you've had enough Llamanian encounters recently.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:31 PM)_

> Sanya: Do you honestly think this is a good idea? After what happened?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:31 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm fine. I enjoy the threats.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:31 PM)_

_Garrick also slaps Emmett on the back like a dad._

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:31 PM)_

> Volentina: You... enjoy the threats?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:31 PM)_

> Emmett: They-

_Emmett feels his back._

> Emmett: Ouch.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:32 PM)_

> Sanya: You're an idiot. This is a stupid plan.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:32 PM)_

> Vargas: HELLO YOU LOSERS!!!

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:32 PM)_

> Emmett: I find their aggression exciting, sheesh. It keeps my mind off of grass.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:32 PM)_

> Emmett: CAN SOMEONE PLEASE GET HIM OUT OF THE BRIG?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:33 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett, you may not understand, but you are the _Most Wanted_ creature ever.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:33 PM)_

> Sanya: Going in there is suicide.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:34 PM)_

> Vargas: I NEED MY PLO-STA-CIAN!!!

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:34 PM)_

> Emmett: So? I have friends with at least...

_Emmett counted on his digits._

> Emmett: 5 Llamanians.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:34 PM)_

> Garrick: Danger is fun, I understand, but you're putting yourself in a LOT of it.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:34 PM)_

> Sanya: You, new girl, go grab the crazy guy. Emmett, i'm not letting you go in there.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:35 PM)_

> Volentina: I'm not touching that thing

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:35 PM)_

> Emmett: Fine, fine. I'll stay behind...

_Emmett did the funny tiny smile._

> Emmett: In exchange for some grass.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:35 PM)_

> Vargas: Hey I can hear you you know.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:35 PM)_

_Sanya glares at Emmett._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:35 PM)_

_emmet funy_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:35 PM)_

> Emmett: Come on!

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:35 PM)_

> Sanya: No.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:35 PM)_

> Emmett: It's been seven equinoxes.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:36 PM)_

> Vargas: Im basically a cyborg you know.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:36 PM)_
8ball Is the ship pretty close to the place?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 03:36 PM)_
Spell it with me now, N-O.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:36 PM)_

> Volentina: Well use one of your cybernetic enhancements to quiet down.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:36 PM)_

> Vargas: I'm a Biogenic

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:37 PM)_

> Emmett: We have some time. Just let me have my grass and I'll think of something.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_

> Vargas: WHERE IS MY FUCKING PLOSTACIAN!!!

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_
8ball Does Emmett have a secret stash of grass?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_
Yes but actually no.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_

> Vargas: Hey try it Emmet

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_

> Emmett: Try what?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_

> Vargas: Its better than grass.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_

> Seth: Fortnite

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_

> Sanya: Shut up, Seth.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_

> Vargas: Plosatcian of course.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:38 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth, turn down your volume. I can hear her moans.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:39 PM)_

> Seth: Uno Momento por favor

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:39 PM)_

> Vargas: Can i get some clean pants though for real these are shitty. Literally.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:39 PM)_

> Emmett: Don't think I can understand you.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:39 PM)_

> Volentina: You can find some in the janitor closet probably

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:39 PM)_

> Sanya: Emmett, listen to me. You are not going in there.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:39 PM)_

> Vargas: I'm in the brig.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:39 PM)_

> Vargas: Let me go.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:40 PM)_

> Emmett: Please. I need this.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:40 PM)_

_Seth turns off his comms and finishes up before exiting his room fully nude_

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:40 PM)_

> Vargas: In your place as bait.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:40 PM)_

> Seth: The hero of the story has arrived.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:40 PM)_

> Sanya: No, Emmett. You're insane.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:40 PM)_

> Emmett: I will literally ignite my mouth and eat whatever ashes there are if you don't let me.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:40 PM)_

> Vargas: I just need a ounce of plostacian.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:40 PM)_

> Seth: Do not fret civilians.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:40 PM)_

> Garrick: Welcome to the pity party.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)_

> Sanya: Put some clothes on, Dumbass.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)_

> Emmett: WE-

_Emmett's pupils followed Seth's floppy dong for a second._

> Emmett: EW.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)_

> Vargas: \

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)_

> Emmett: GET THAT AWAY.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)_

> Seth: For Sethman is here with his superdong

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)_

> Garrick: By the way, Seth.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)_

> Garrick: I found the Ottori girl you rescued a few GUYs ago.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)_

_D: I hate this place._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:41 PM)_

> Garrick: She's alive, somehow.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)_

_Seth shakes his dong around flinging vaginal fluids and cum all over the place_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm going to tend to the prisoner.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)_

> Sanya: Garrick, come here.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)_

_Emmett shielded his eyes and proceeded to leave to the brig._

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)_

> Seth: Thats cool, what about her?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:42 PM)_

_Sanya turns off her comms._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Vargas: Can someone let me out so i can wash my shit covered ass and get a change of clothes please?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Garrick: She needs a room.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Emmett: Dude.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Seth: Why?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Garrick: Me and Chomsky only have 2 beds.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Emmett: There's a toilet literally right next to you.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Seth: Get another bed then.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Seth: Heres some money

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Vargas: this happened when i passed out and died for a second.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

_Emmett fingered the numpad for a bit, unlocking the cell door._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Garrick: Alright, I'll just assign her a room myself, then.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:43 PM)_

> Garrick: What's up, Sanya?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)_

> Emmett: Can you behave, please?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)_

> Vargas: Thanks.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)_

> Emmett: We have no prostacian or whatever it is.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)_

> Vargas: As long as my plostacian is ok.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)_

_Seth digs in his urethra and takes out 300 ducketts, he throws them at Garrick_

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:44 PM)_

> Seth: Now go buy a bed.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)_

_Sanya starts to whisper_

> Sanya: Garrick, we need to make sure Emmett doesn't go in there.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)_

> Garrick: Gross. Here you go, Sanya.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)_

> Emmett: Where's your "plostacian"?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)_

> Emmett: I never heard of it.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)_

_Garrick tosses the urethra Ducketts to Sanya._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)_

_Vargas sees this as he walks out of the brig_

> Vargas: What the fuck!

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:45 PM)_

> Garrick: Emmett, do you have another bed?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

> Sanya: Gross.

_She throws them behind her._

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

_Seth turns beet red and begins erupting smoke out of his pores because he is so mad_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

> Emmett: What's wrong, 8ball man?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

> Vargas: Nothing.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

> Sanya: Garrick, I have an idea.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

> Vargas: Its with the stuff you took.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

> Garrick: SQUEMFET

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

> Emmett: I didn't take anything. Maybe Seth did.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:46 PM)_

_Seth's head turns into a volcano and starts erupting as Seth starts to uncontrollably scream_

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_

> Vargas: Take a ounce of it. Its good shit man.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_

> Emmett: GARRICK, HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_
8ball Does Volentina have a functioning Gameboy?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_
Nope.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_

> Vargas: SEEEEEEEEEEETH.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_

> Seth: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_

> Sanya: Why is everyone screaming?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_
8ball does emmet really ave my stuff

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_
No.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_

> Emmett: What the hell is going on?!

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:47 PM)_

> Garrick: I'VE KNOWN YOUR NAME FOR 4 GUYS. ANYWAYS CAN THE OTTORI ROOM WITH YOU AND DAKARI?!?!

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_

> Vargas: Give me my plostacian.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_

> Garrick: Yes. Sanya. What is your plan.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_
Volentina wandered out of the brig, namely away from the noise.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_

> Vargas: Seth.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_

> Sanya: Listen, turn off your comms.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_

_Emmett muttered._

> Emmett: oh yeah, technically i did tell you that.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_

> Emmett: I have a bed. There's an Ottori?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:48 PM)_

> Sanya: I have an idea. Emmett's currently not in his right mind.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)_

> Seth: FORTNITE FORTNITE FORTNITE

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)_

> Garrick: Yeah, Seth rescued her and she got stuck in my pockets.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)_

> Vargas: PLOSTACIAN WILL CLEAR THAT RIGHT UP!

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)_

> Emmett: I see.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)_

> Vargas: Luckily i have some in my secret shirt pocket.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:49 PM)_

> Emmett: You want me to make some space?

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

_Seth takes out a small wood pipe and puts on an old fashioned suit and tie_

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

> Garrick: Yeah, we don't have any space in our room.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

> Garrick: You could double up, Sanya.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

_Emmett tried to cover his ears from the screaming 8ball head._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

> Sanya: Actually, i may have an idea

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

> Vargas: Yes please.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

> Garrick: I'll be right back.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

_He then takes out a library with a fireplace and an armchair_

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:50 PM)_

_Vargas takes a quick sniff._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

_Garrick leaves to tell Jess of her room reassignment._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

> Vargas: Thats some good shit right there.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

_Seth pulls a book from the bookcase and then sits down, lighting his pipe_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

> Sanya: If Garrick won't help, i may have to do this myself.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

> Emmett: You think she has any skills for the crew?

_Emmett walked over to the crew quarters block._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

> Vargas: Its better than grass Emmet. I promise.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_
emet

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

> Emmett: Garrick?

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:51 PM)_

> Seth: Chapter One, Why I hate Mathias

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

> Emmett: You turn your coms off?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

> Garrick: No, I can hear you.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

_Sanya followed Emmett, walking with him._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

> Emmett: Matthias was kind-of a douche, yeah.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

> Garrick: She might. She had to survive in my pockets.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

_Vargas follows Emmet._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

> Vargas: Where are the showers.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

_Garrick follows Emmett._

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:52 PM)_

> Volentina: Huh.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Vargas: By the way my name is Vargas.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Emmett: Front of the ship and next to the quarters.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

_Jessica follows Garrick._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Garrick: Here's your roommate.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

_Emmett turns around, seeing the apparent conga line._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Vargas: Thank you also who are you two.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Emmett: Uh... Oh hi!

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Sanya: I swear.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Seth: Reason one, Matthias feigns superiority even though he is a bird that is unable to fly

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:53 PM)_

> Garrick: "Hey."

_She barely recognizes him._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

_Emmett stiffened his back and put his hoof on the back of his horns._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

> Garrick: Also, she needs clothes... HEY, SANYA

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

> Emmett: Jeez, it's been a long time.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll check.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

> Vargas: So who are you Two?

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

> Seth: Reason 2

_Seth takes a puff of his pipe_

> Seth: I hate birds

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

> Garrick: Oh, you're right there.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:54 PM)_

_Seth blows smoke into the comms, causing smoke to emit from everyone's comms_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)_

_Emmett turns down his comms and tries to have a conversation with the Ottori. He waved away the smoke promptly._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)_

> Emmett: Let's introduce ourselves again.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)_

> Seth: Reason 3, He is an asshole.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm Squemfet Tawfeek, but you can just call me Emmett.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:55 PM)_
(Sean, Isn't Matthias in your fanny pack)

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)_

_Matthias is angrily cawking from Seth's satchel._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)_
Who is in my pockets

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)_
Yes

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)_

> Seth: Chapter 2, My relationship with Goddess of Lust

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, if it's an issue, I have clothing for her.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)_

> Garrick: "I'm Jessica. Jess is fine."

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:56 PM)_

> Vargas: Oh never mind its just plostacian.

_Vargas takes a quick bump._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)_

> Sanya: Alright.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)_

> Emmett: Follow me, Jess.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)_

> Seth: There once was a fine young lady with a big busom and even bigger tush, I fancied her quite a bit back in my younger years. Every boy in town wanted a go at her, just to know how a romp with her would feel

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)_

_Sanya reaches up her hand to her flower, to receive an old kimono_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:57 PM)_

> Sanya: Here.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)_

> Garrick: "Okay."

_She hesitantly follows._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)_
Ima wash up see you Sanya? and Garrick?

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)_

> Volentina: Better.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)_

_Emmett went into his room and opened the closet, making no mind to the sleeping Dakari. In it was a large variety of burgundy red elven shirts with various warm highlights._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:58 PM)_

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

_Sanya walks over to Emmetts room._

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

> Seth: This isn't about her. Instead, this is about an immortal goddess with perky tits, a flat stomach, and a bouncy ass, the very same one who is the reason for my curse

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

> Emmett: Seth, what are you doing?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

_Sanya throws the kimono in the room_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 03:59 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

_Emmett shrugged._

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

> Seth: Indeed I did.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

> Vargas: Hello everyone.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:00 PM)_

_Emmett hopped back onto his bed and leaned against the wall._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Sanya: Do you know how to hardlock a door?

_She whispers_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Emmett: "THE RESTAURANT, LLAMANIAN UNDERGROUND, HAS ALMOST BEEN REACHED."

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Vargas: Sooooo Seth, want some drugs?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

_The ottori also puts on actual clothes._

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Seth: GARRICK, NO CUMMING

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

_Emmett shielded his eyes, respecting her privacy._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Sanya: We need to keep Emmett in here.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Seth: Im sorry what was that?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

> Vargas: WHAT THE FUCK!!!!

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:01 PM)_

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

> Vargas: For some plostacian of course. I just need one ounce.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

_Emmett's jaw drops to the floor, his eyes extend at a velocity never before seen, he takes out a boxing glove and hits himself with it 17 times, pants like a dog, and yells AOOOOGA AOOOOGA then turns to the audience and says in 1930's New York accent “HOT MAMA, now that's a dame!"_

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

> Seth: We dont do drugs on this ship

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

> Emmett: Vargas. Please shut up.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:03 PM)_

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

> Vargas: Yeah Seth?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

> Emmett: You just don't want me to have my race's drugs.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

_Seth turns his head 360 degrees and extends his neck out to Emmett's face_

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

> Vargas: Vargas traps Emmet in the ship and headsout as the decoy.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

_Garrick sneaks over and shuts the room door while Emmett is AWOOGAing at Jess._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

_Emmett's arms shook a bit from withdrawals._

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:04 PM)_

> Seth: Repeat that again sonny?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)_

> Sanya: Garrick, if you can, i need you to lock him in his room. We can't let him go out there.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm turning off video comms.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:05 PM)_

> Emmett: You're fucking creepy.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:06 PM)_

_Emmett looks at the Ottori and frowns a little._

> Emmett: Sorry for my language.

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:06 PM)_

> Seth: shut up boy!

**Sean** _(04-Jun-20 04:06 PM)_

> Seth: YOU SHAN'T SPEAK TO YOUR DADDY THAT WAY

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:07 PM)_

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

> Volentina: If he actually does manage to find the target, what then? Do we trap it or do we have weapons to attack?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:26 PM)_

_Emmett looks to the LED air conditioning unit._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

> Sanya: When we get a good shot, they're as good as dead.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:27 PM)_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_

> Sanya: Wait, new plan

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_

_Emmett shivered._

> Emmett: You want to talk to pass the time?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_

> Garrick: If you can successfully complete this mission, we will buy you as many drugs as you want.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_

> Garrick: I hope you overdose.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:28 PM)_

> Garrick: Whoops, I didn't mean to say that out loud.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_

> Sanya: See if you can slip some of your drugs in the clients' food.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_

> Vargas: Fuck you Garrick.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll stab him in the bathroom.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:29 PM)_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:30 PM)_

Richard Jamerez

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Vargas: 5 ounces is the safe at most. 7ounces ok

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Garrick: If he dies in the restaurant, it'll be suspicious.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't really know why the galaxy is against me.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Sanya: We don't want him dead in the middle of the restaurant. Exactly

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Sanya: It's better if someone else finds him dead.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_

> Emmett: I didn't do anything wrong.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:31 PM)_
Yeah but it takes a few minutes for it to get through the system

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

> Garrick: "Who's after you?"

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

_Emmett takes off his watch and sticks it on the bedside table._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

> Emmett: Everyone, really.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

> Emmett: Even Vargas, I think. The stupid 8ball guy.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't really do much to protect myself though.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:32 PM)_
"I'm after you!" Romantic music starts playing, the lighting becomes sepia, their eyes become hearts

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:33 PM)_

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 04:33 PM)_

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

> Theylin: Sanya, what's my job?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

> Vargas: I can set it up to look like he was doing a line.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 04:34 PM)_

> Volentina: You could put enough in to poison the target, but not enough to kill him near instantly.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Sanya: Just listen to me. Get the job done.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Vargas: Exactly.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

_Emmett pushed his cheek into her fur._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: And I have no freedom.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:35 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Emmett: What about you?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Sanya: Robot, if you fuck this up, i will kill you myself.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:36 PM)_

> Sanya: This plan will work, IF you follow the plan.

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Theylin: What do /i do?

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_
We will ask my 8ball

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Garrick: "I've been kinda stuck in darkness for, like, 17 years. Life before all that was pretty nice, though."

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Emmett: You tried to marry Garrick, right?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:37 PM)_

> Sanya: Just stay in the ship. Too many chefs in the kitchen ruins the dish.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 04:38 PM)_

_Vargas drugs the right plates this time._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:59 PM)_

> Emmett: "You notice that weird black guy?"

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 04:59 PM)_

> Emmett: "Strange how they let these people in here."

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 04:59 PM)_

> Sanya: Yeah. He's off-putting.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_

> Emmett: Damn!

_Emmett accidentally drops her onto his bed._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_

> Emmett: I meant to place her down.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm a terrible friend.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_

> Garrick: Be careful, dude.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_

_Vargas sneaks into the back kitchen._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_

> Garrick: Anyways, you think Iris could fix her?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_

> Garrick: We don't have a medic.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_

> Emmett: Iris would probably bake her a cast.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_

> Emmett: Or whatever.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_

> Emmett: I'll take care of her.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_
8ball does Vargas successfully drug the target.

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_
NOOOOOO!

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:01 PM)_

> Emmett: I know you guys wanted to keep me safe and all.

**Michael** _(04-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_
8ball does Theylin eat pie?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_
You don't got it.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

> Emmett: "Waiter!"

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

_The target doesn't notice his weird behavior yet._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

> Emmett: "Come here and get the flower some water. She looks dry."

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_

> Emmett: But honestly, I don't think I'm safe.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:03 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, thank you.

_Sanya fucking hates this man. So much._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:03 PM)_

> Emmett: Maybe that's the reason what the Llamanians want me gone.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:03 PM)_

> Emmett: We're vile creatures.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:04 PM)_

> Sanya: Now, shall we talk about the elephant in the room?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:04 PM)_

> Emmett: "Good on him. Give me some sparkling tea."

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:04 PM)_

> Emmett: "What's an elephant?"

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:04 PM)_

_Garrick sighs._

> Garrick: This whole Crave thing only exists because of your withdrawals. The fact that it's happening at least proves that it's working.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:04 PM)_

> Garrick: Don't worry about it.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

_Vargas Jumps off the roof._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

> Emmett: "Did you hear someone fall off the roof?"

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

> Sanya: Ah, it's an old Earth Saying. It was apparently an animal. I believe the saying refers to bigger issues.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm exhausted, Garrick.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

> Sanya: Oh, i think it's that offputting man.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

> Emmett: I've been exhausted for days.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

> Emmett: Nothing has helped.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

> Emmett: "I don't see any problems aside from you acting odd. Come and have a seat. Drink."

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

> Emmett: "Food will be out soon."

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_
ok.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_

> Sanya: Yes, yes. Apologies. The strangeness of the diner must be getting to me.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_

> Emmett: "Yes. Strangeness."

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_

_Richard pulls out his acid blaster from beneath the table._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_

_Sanya notices the rustling, and slowly pulls out her knife._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_

> Emmett: "You think I'm retarded?"

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_

> Sanya: You wouldn't want to make a scene, would you?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_

_Emmett yawns._

> Emmett: Can you please get out of my room?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_

> Emmett: I'm trying to get some shuteye.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:09 PM)_

> Garrick: Sure, man. You keeping Jess with you?

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:09 PM)_

> Sanya: Listen to me, here and now. You've very clearly never met a Floran.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 05:09 PM)_

> Volentina: Uh oh.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:09 PM)_

> Emmett: I'll try to keep her intact.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:09 PM)_
None of her bones are broken or anything she just got the wind knocked out of her

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 05:10 PM)_

> Volentina: Uh guys, things are starting to turn sour.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:10 PM)_

_Vargas wakes up and walks into the diner._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:10 PM)_

> Vargas: That was fun.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:10 PM)_

> Sanya: While my crew maybe be retarded, i assure you, i am a trained assassin.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:10 PM)_

> Sanya: So do not test me.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:11 PM)_

> Emmett: "I bet you're hiding something valuable in that yacht of yours."

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:11 PM)_

_Garrick leaves the room._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:11 PM)_

> Sanya: Maybe. But I assure you, you won't get a chance to learn.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:11 PM)_

_The lights also went back on after Garrick unlocked the door._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:11 PM)_

_Emmett stares at the wreckage. He picks up his holodevice and kicks some desk rubble into the hallway._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:12 PM)_
8ball does Garrick turn his comms back on

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 05:12 PM)_
Nah.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:12 PM)_

> Emmett: "Trust me, I'll learn."

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:12 PM)_

_Richard stands up, and four more Llamanians come in front of him._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:12 PM)_

> Garrick: I'm just gonna go get something from the fridge...

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:12 PM)_

> Emmett: "Take care of the egotistical flower for me."

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:12 PM)_

> Sanya: Cocky. I like that. Makes the meat tastier when they try to fight back.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:13 PM)_

> Vargas: Hey who wants to fight me!?! Winner gets 10 pounds of weed.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:13 PM)_

_Sanya draws her Sword_

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 05:13 PM)_

> Volentina: Hello? Things are starting to get worse.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:13 PM)_

_The Llamanians crowd her. He zips off to the ship._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:13 PM)_

> Sanya: Robot, After Him!

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:13 PM)_

_Vargas attacks him._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:13 PM)_

_Garrick feels a disturbance in the force and turns his comms back on._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:13 PM)_

> Garrick: Everything alright in there?

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

> Volentina: No! Quite the opposite!

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

_Sanya Cuts down the first Llamanian easily._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_
No. In fact, the opposite happens.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

_Emmett gets to his watch and mutters into it._

> Emmett: Sorry man---er, woman. I need to make sure I didn't hurt someone. Good night.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

> Volentina: It's a bust, target has taken off and Sanya's surrounded

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

> Vargas: Im not a robot im a BIOGENIC.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

> Sanya: All for me? You shouldn't have.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll eat well for quite a while.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

_Richard opens up the Pummeler hatch and explores._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

> Sanya: AFTER HIM!

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:15 PM)_
8ball does Garrick hear the hatch open

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 05:15 PM)_
Yes, but in a monotonous tone.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:15 PM)_

> Sanya: GARRICK, WE HAVE AN INTRUDER!

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:15 PM)_

_Vargas chases him with his superspeed._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:15 PM)_

> Garrick: Uh, yeah, I noticed.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:15 PM)_

_Sanya cuts down 2 more_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:15 PM)_

> Emmett: "Nice place you got here."

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:15 PM)_

_Vargas tackles him._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:15 PM)_

_Garrick draws his Skeletal Khopesh._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:15 PM)_

> Garrick: You know, we had a plan and all, but there were no specifications as to how we kill you.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:17 PM)_

> Emmett: "I'll drain your fluid, 8ball."

_He kicks Varga to the side and sprays him with the acid blaster. He then looks to Garrick._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:17 PM)_

_Sanya finishes up in the diner and runs to the ship._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:17 PM)_

_Vargas pulls out his swords._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:17 PM)_

> Sanya: Listen, Meat. This is the end.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:17 PM)_

_After wiping the acid off._

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:18 PM)_

> Emmett: "You know, there's no specifications that you guys get to kill me."

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:18 PM)_

> Garrick: Oh, trust me. I will.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:18 PM)_

_Garrick takes a few swings at Richard._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:18 PM)_

_Vargas slashes his leg._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:18 PM)_

> Sanya: He's mine. I had to eat dinner with this bastard.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:18 PM)_
8ball Does Richard hop over the Floran and run into the depths of the ship?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 05:18 PM)_
Person who's before you decides!

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:19 PM)_
No, because he got his legs slashed and falls over

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:19 PM)_

_Vargas drives the sword through him._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:19 PM)_

_Sanya picks the llama_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:19 PM)_

_Richard takes out his comms._

> Emmett: "Backup, now."

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:19 PM)_
8ball Does Sanya stb him, here and now?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 05:19 PM)_
Most likely.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:20 PM)_

_A quick stab to the chest_

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:20 PM)_

_But fails to hit anything vital_

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 05:20 PM)_

> Volentina: There's more coming towards the ship and fast!

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:21 PM)_

_Richard holds his chest, dropping the blaster._

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:21 PM)_
8ball does Vargas kill Robert

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 05:21 PM)_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:21 PM)_

> Sanya: Resilient, aren't you?

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:21 PM)_

> Garrick: We got backup to worry about. You two take care of him, I'll meet up with Girl.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:21 PM)_

> Emmett: "You're lucky I forwent getting those chest implants."

_He said this while panting._

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 05:22 PM)_
8ball Does Volentina find an item outside the ship to attempt to hold off backup?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 05:22 PM)_

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:22 PM)_

_Garrick meets up with Girl AKA Volentina_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:22 PM)_

> Sanya: Lucky, lucky me. Means it's easy to eat you.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:22 PM)_

_A group of Llamanian guards come in, each with plasma blasters with anti-spectral enhancements._

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 05:22 PM)_

> Volentina: So, I have no weapon. And there's a lot on the way.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:22 PM)_

> Sanya: It's a real shame you came this far.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:22 PM)_

_Garrick pulls out a Bee Gun._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:22 PM)_

> Garrick: Here you go, Teddy.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:23 PM)_

> Sanya: Robot, go help with the backup.

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:23 PM)_

_He tosses it to Volentina._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:23 PM)_

> Sanya: I'll stay with the corpse here.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:23 PM)_

_Vargas elbows him in the stomach._

> Vargas: Bitch.

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 05:23 PM)_

> Volentina: What the hell is this- Whatever, how does it work?

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:23 PM)_

_Emmett tosses all of the rubble out and sits on the edge of his bed, brandishing his Maggo._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:23 PM)_

> Garrick: It shoots bees.

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:23 PM)_

> Emmett: "Herte? What are you? Fermian?"

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:23 PM)_

_Richard was slowly crawling away._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:24 PM)_

_Garrick replaces his Khopesh with a Hammer._

**Preston** _(04-Jun-20 05:24 PM)_

_Vargas stabs him a bunch._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:24 PM)_

_Sanya stabs his pant leg, keeping him stuck._

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:24 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Jun-20 05:24 PM)_
8ball Do the Llamanians start to fire?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 05:24 PM)_
Yigga.

**Charles** _(04-Jun-20 05:25 PM)_

_Vargas runs over there._

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:25 PM)_

**Trey** _(04-Jun-20 05:25 PM)_
8ball Does Garrick throw the Hammer and knock a few down like bowling pins

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 05:25 PM)_

8ball Does Sanya stab his hand in place?

**FFBot** _(04-Jun-20 05:26 PM)_
My reply is no.

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:27 PM)_

_She falls to the ground_

**Brody** _(04-Jun-20 05:27 PM)_
