**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 04:45 PM)_
8ball Is the ship setting course to Zarazoga-9?

**FFBot** _(09-Jun-20 04:45 PM)_
Spanish no.

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:46 PM)_
8ball does the ship head towards Zarazoga-9?

**FFBot** _(09-Jun-20 04:46 PM)_
Outlook bad.

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 04:46 PM)_

_Is currently working on his prototypes_

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 04:46 PM)_

_Emmett stretches and wakes up. He was pretty well rested, given that he was the earliest to fall and the latest to wake up._

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_

_Vargas gets up and falls._

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_

_Emmett puts on his communicator._

> Emmett: Goood morning, everyone!

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_

> Theylin: Hey Emmett

**Preston** _(09-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_

_Volentina was just wandering around the place, cleaning around a little_

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:47 PM)_

> Vargas: \*Morning .

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 04:48 PM)_

> Theylin: So what's the plan for today?

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 04:48 PM)_

_Mateo does a routine check of his belongings, finding everything is in place._

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 04:48 PM)_

_starts walking towards the kitchen_

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 04:48 PM)_

> Emmett: Good as usual.

_The moment Emmett got out of his bed, he noticed how messy and stained his bed was. Sheesh, he had a rough night._
8ball Is there a random snack sitting on his bedside table, there from an unknown person?

**FFBot** _(09-Jun-20 04:48 PM)_
No.

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:49 PM)_

> Vargas: Can i get some help getting up? I'm to weak to walk on my own.

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 04:49 PM)_

> Emmett: Huh. I need a shower.

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 04:49 PM)_
8ball does Theylin find anyone else in the kitchen?

**FFBot** _(09-Jun-20 04:49 PM)_
Neigh.

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 04:49 PM)_

_starts speaking through his communicator_

> Theylin: Hey Emmett, where is the food exactly?

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 04:49 PM)_

> Emmett: Anyhow, everyone, we're going to a mystery place. Garrick and Sanya call it a treat or a vacation on their behalf.

_Mateo walks out to the kitchen to prepare something simple_

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 04:50 PM)_

> Theylin: Oh, Hello uhhhh..... what's your name? I don't believe we've had the pleasure of meeting each other

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 04:50 PM)_

> Emmett: Brahmin Biscuts. Straight classic.
> Emmett: Food's in the fridge or the cupboards, Theylin.

**Preston** _(09-Jun-20 04:50 PM)_
8ball does volentina pull a Nutri-grain bar in her scarf?

**FFBot** _(09-Jun-20 04:50 PM)_
Spell it with me now, Y-E-S.

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:50 PM)_

> Vargas: Anyone?

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 04:51 PM)_

> Emmett: Name's Mateo. Et toi?

**Preston** _(09-Jun-20 04:51 PM)_

_Volentina begins humming quietly to herself as she nibbles on the bar_

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:51 PM)_

> Vargas: Can i at least get some crutches.

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:51 PM)_

> Vargas: Whatever.

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 04:52 PM)_

> Theylin: Name's Theylin, joined up about a week ago. Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

_wipes off the motor oil that's on his hands and holds out his hands to shake hands with Mateo_

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:52 PM)_

_Vargas slowly walks to the kitchen._

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:52 PM)_

_Vargas ignores Theylin because of his greasy hands._

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 04:52 PM)_

> Emmett: You look like the first grease monkey on this ship.

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:53 PM)_

> Vargas: Funny.

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:53 PM)_

_Vargas chuckles._

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 04:53 PM)_

> Theylin: I was up for the position of a Grand Engineer from where I came from, had to turn it down due to needing to go on my pilgrimage

**Preston** _(09-Jun-20 04:54 PM)_

> Volentina: Just please don't get things messy

_Volentina spoke to Theylin as she walked past_

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 04:54 PM)_

> Emmett: Everyone else seems either batshi- um, batCRAP, crazy, or wanted in some sector.

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:54 PM)_

> Vargas: Not meeeeeee.

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 04:55 PM)_

> Theylin: That sucks, well hopefully I'll stay not crazy.

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 04:55 PM)_

> Emmett: You never know in this world.

**Preston** _(09-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

_Volentina broke her Nutri-Grain bar in half and held it out towards Mateo_

> Volentina: I don't believe I've seen you here yet?

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

_Vargas shakes his 8ball and ask_

> Vargas: Should i have cereal for breakfast?

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

> Theylin: True that dude, now I gotta get back before my prototype combusts on itself, if you ever need any tune ups on your gear or equipment just head to my room.

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

> Emmett: Probably not. I've spent this week tending to my gear.

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

_Mateo gladly accepts the grain bar._

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:56 PM)_

> Vargas: Could you sharpen my swords?

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 04:57 PM)_

> Theylin: You want me to waste my time doing something that'll take you 10 minutes with a whet stone?

**Preston** _(09-Jun-20 04:58 PM)_

_She gives a subtle nod before going back to wandering around the ship_

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 04:58 PM)_

> Vargas: Where's Emmet?

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 04:58 PM)_

_sigh_

> Theylin: Bring it by my shop and I'll take a look at it.

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_
8ball does Vargas have biotenic swords?

**FFBot** _(09-Jun-20 05:00 PM)_
Yay.

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_
8ball Did Mateo manage to keep his entire arsenal when passing through checkpoints?

**FFBot** _(09-Jun-20 05:02 PM)_
Don't count on it.

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:03 PM)_

_As soon as Emmett reached the bathroom, Emmett felt a weight upon his neck. He checked and noticed a leash. Emmett panicked._

> Emmett: Fuck!

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:03 PM)_

> Emmett: Not again!

**Trey** _(09-Jun-20 05:03 PM)_
I'll be on in a second

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:04 PM)_

> Emmett: Still rather disappointing I lost some of my arsenal.

_Emmett tried to take off the leash to no avail._

> Emmett: Oh come on. Garrick?!

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 05:04 PM)_
8ball is Theylin able to draft up a blueprint to show one of the captains for approval?

**FFBot** _(09-Jun-20 05:04 PM)_
It is certain.

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 05:04 PM)_

_speaks through his communicator_

> Theylin: Emmett please come to my room, I have something to show you

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

> Emmett: Who is speaking, again?

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

> Vargas: Vargas follows being noisy.

**Michael** _(09-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

> Theylin: Theylin a.k.a Waterboy

**Charles** _(09-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

_He whispers to himself._

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

-   (edited)

    **Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:05 PM)_

    > Emmett: I'll be in there then. Wait a moment. You don't have a room.

    **Preston** _(09-Jun-20 05:06 PM)_

    _Volentina would soon circle back around, running into Mateo_

    > Volentina: Hello again.

    **Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_

    > Emmett: Are you talking about the living block?

    **Michael** _(09-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_

    > Theylin: Yes Captain

    **Charles** _(09-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_

    _Vargas crashes into Volantina trying to follow them._

    **Preston** _(09-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_
    8ball Does Volentina have a smooth stone to fidget with?

    **FFBot** _(09-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_
    Majority rules! Vote on it!

    **Charles** _(09-Jun-20 05:07 PM)_

    > Vargas: Ow!

    **Preston** _(09-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_

    _She was rubbing a stone in her hand_

    **Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_

    _Emmett took the end of the leash and walked himself over to the living room. He smelled like wet dog from all of his sweat in the night._

    **Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:08 PM)_

    > Emmett: Yes, They-lin?

    **Michael** _(09-Jun-20 05:09 PM)_

    _stares at Emmett's leash for a second_

    > Theylin: Why do you have a leash on?

    **Charles** _(09-Jun-20 05:09 PM)_

    > Vargas: What is that Volantina?

    **Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:09 PM)_

    > Emmett: Garrick put it on me to prank me, I think.

    _Mateo notices the fidgeting Volentina is doing._

    **Michael** _(09-Jun-20 05:09 PM)_

    > Theylin: That's a bruh moment

    **Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:09 PM)_

    > Emmett: Habit?
    > Emmett: Either that, or Jess.
    > Emmett: Where is she, anyhow?

    **Preston** _(09-Jun-20 05:10 PM)_

    > Volentina: A little bit yeah. Really noticeable?

    **Charles** _(09-Jun-20 05:11 PM)_

    _Vargas starts watching Theylin and Emmett._

    **Michael** _(09-Jun-20 05:11 PM)_

    > Theylin: This would have us require less fuel and allow our engines to partially be powered by solar power. I would like your permission to build a prototype and eventually implement it on our ship

    **Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:11 PM)_

    _Vargas whispers to himself._

    **Preston** _(09-Jun-20 05:12 PM)_

    **Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:13 PM)_

    > Emmett: Comes with the trade.
    > Emmett: Let me see that.

    _Emmett took the blueprints over and checked them out._

    **Charles** _(09-Jun-20 05:13 PM)_

    _Vargas just sits nearby eavsdropping._

    **Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:13 PM)_
    8ball Can Emmett comprehend the blueprints?

    **FFBot** _(09-Jun-20 05:13 PM)_

    **Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

    > Emmett: Yeesh, your writing is... It's something.
    > Emmett: Well, I'd be dead by now if I wasn't this perceptive.
    > Emmett: Did I mention my time in the GSS?

    **Michael** _(09-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

    > Theylin: Well, I'm used to writing underwater... sorry mate

    **Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

    **Preston** _(09-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

    _She gave a bit of a half shrug_

    > Volentina: Fair. And I can't say you have, do tell?

    **Charles** _(09-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

    > Vargas: No Mateo.

    **Michael** _(09-Jun-20 05:14 PM)_

    **Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:15 PM)_

    **Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:16 PM)_

    _Emmett hadn't noticed the ghost._

    **Trey** _(09-Jun-20 05:16 PM)_

    _He flips on his comms._

    > Garrick: Yo, Emmett. You're finally up.

    **Michael** _(09-Jun-20 05:16 PM)_

    **Trey** _(09-Jun-20 05:16 PM)_

    > Garrick: What's with the leash?

    **Preston** _(09-Jun-20 05:16 PM)_

    > Volentina: Sounds like you joined the military.

    _She let out a bit of laughter_

    **Charles** _(09-Jun-20 05:16 PM)_

    > Vargas: How about my old ship?

    **Michael** _(09-Jun-20 05:16 PM)_

    **Trey** _(09-Jun-20 05:19 PM)_

    > Garrick: Well, I did. But you do that a lot, so I ignored you.

    **Preston** _(09-Jun-20 05:19 PM)_

    > Emmett: Yep. A bunch of old men throwing their children at each other.
    > Emmett: Wait.

    **Preston** _(09-Jun-20 05:20 PM)_

**Preston** _(09-Jun-20 05:35 PM)_

**Sean** _(09-Jun-20 05:38 PM)_

_Seth puts Emmett down in the seat_

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:38 PM)_

> Emmett: It's one of those things where you either die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.

**Preston** _(09-Jun-20 05:38 PM)_

> Volentina: Fair. Only question is, how long would it take to become the villain?

**Sean** _(09-Jun-20 05:39 PM)_

> Seth: This is Alcoholics Anonymous, here they will help you Roger

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:39 PM)_

_Seth opens a can of peas_

**Preston** _(09-Jun-20 05:40 PM)_

**Sean** _(09-Jun-20 05:40 PM)_

> Seth: Eat your peas Hayley

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:40 PM)_

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:41 PM)_

_Emmett spits out the can and makes a run for it._

**Sean** _(09-Jun-20 05:41 PM)_

> Seth: So you can grow strong enough to fight off president Clinton's sexual advances

**Preston** _(09-Jun-20 05:41 PM)_

> Volentina: I wouldn't. Those people try to make something of it. Look for an opportunity in it I guess.

**Zander** _(09-Jun-20 05:42 PM)_

_Emmett bruised his chin on the fall._

**Sean** _(09-Jun-20 05:42 PM)_

**Sean** _(09-Jun-20 05:44 PM)_

_Seth flops onto the ground into the fetal position and begins to sleep_
