**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Garrick: Sanya's head parasite.

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:15 PM)_

> Emmett: You're not a stead, but you're supposedly my protector.

_Emmett pulls his digit away, unfazed by the bite._

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:15 PM)_

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:15 PM)_

**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Garrick: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:16 PM)_

_Sanya continues to walk on, unfazed by the goat's weight._

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:16 PM)_
this whole episode, wemmfort should dedicate to find out who sanya is.
(edited)

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:16 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Seriously, who's sanya?

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:18 PM)_

> Wemmfort: What the heck was that thing in the toilet?

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:20 PM)_

_Emmett, as usual, is wanting to annoy his stead._

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:21 PM)_

> Sanya: For what?

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:21 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't know, but I obliged to your wishes.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:22 PM)_

_Seth finishes up surveying the ship with Olag and Olag gets to work_

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:22 PM)_

_Sanya rolls her eyes, walking into the diner_

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Emmett: So you own me

_Emmett realized what he said._

> Emmett: Freudian slip. You owe me.

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:22 PM)_

_Wemmfort sees a cap on someone's head, and snatches it from the person._

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:22 PM)_

> Seth: Alright guys, so yeah, Olag says it'll take a week and a half

**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Garrick: Wonderful.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Seth: I'm gonna need to borrow 50,000 ducketts but we can get that from the racist we kidnapped right?

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Wemmfort: What's this thing?

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Emmett: Yeah, definitely.

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:23 PM)_

> Sanya: Own you? I'll have to remember that.

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:23 PM)_

_Sanya finds and sits down at a booth._

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:24 PM)_

_Wemmfort pokes it and leans back._

> Wemmfort: I don't think it's alive.

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:24 PM)_

_Naturally, Emmett was now thinking of the supposed "owning", making him feel embarrassed._

> Emmett: Owe me! Not own!

_Emmett sat at her booth._

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:27 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, any of the smoothies look good to you?

_Emmett was trying to change the tone of their conversation._

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:28 PM)_

_Wemmfort is asleep, because of the conversation._

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Sanya: No. Smoothies don't interest me. I wonder if they sell raw meat...

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Dakari: Hey who's paying?

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Seth: Now give me a double McSpanky with fries and a Flurp

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:28 PM)_

> Dakari: For ourselves?

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_

_Sanya starts to survey the menu._

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Emmett: Why would a diner sell raw meat?

**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Garrick: Cooked meat, maybe...

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_

_Wemmfort is taking up 2 seats, cause he's asleep._

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_
8ball Is Emmett feeling more vegetarian today?

**FFBot** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_
Reply hazy try again :8ball:

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Sanya: If they sell cooked meat, why wouldn't they sell raw?

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_
8ball Is Emmett feeling more vegetarian today?

**FFBot** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_
It is certain :8ball:

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Seth: Substitute the patty with Dwarf please, if you have no Dwarf then give me uhhhhhh, Drow

**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:29 PM)_

> Garrick: Order a bleu rare steak.

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya, you're a plant. Tell me the hottest salad or whatever.

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:30 PM)_

_Wemmfort feels a burning sensation and quickly wakes up._

> Wemmfort: WATER! WATER!

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:30 PM)_

_Volonta rolls over on his skates towards the group_

> Volentina: Have you all decided your orders for today?

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Seth: "A double McSpanky with fries and a Flurp, that'll be $6.53. And $3.47 is your change" I hear Jimmy Neutron say. I never saw that little fuck press the buttons with food on them, so I had to go speak to him. "Dude, you're supposed to press the buttons with the pictures of food on â€˜em". I say. "Don't need to Skeet, I memorized the prices and did the tax and change in my head" he replies. Ever since he fucking started at this job, he insists on trying to make things harder on them. Just last week, he had the fucking nerve to call salt "Sodium Chloride". No, you fuckwad, just call it salt. No one gives a shit how you know the basic chemical name of fucking salt. Not to mention that it's not even 100% sodium chloride, it's 98% sodium chloride with 2% trace elements. But he just insists on calling it sodium chloride. This was my moment to ruin this fucking nerd. "Dude, you do know that the pictures there aren't just for prices, right? They are logged and from there, the managers can get a rough estimate on how much food has been used and they can subtract the amount used by their stock so they know how much to order so we don't run out of food for later days. It's not just about prices. And what if you do make a mistake? Even a few cents missing from your drawer will result in potentially a write up, and doing it on numerous shifts can result in you getting fired, especially if you're missing a good amount of money

**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:30 PM)_

> Garrick: Would that be cannibalism?

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:30 PM)_

_wemmfort comes back_

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Emmett: Garrick, where are you?

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_Sanya, confused and slightly offended, glares at the goat_

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Seth: Anyways with that out of the way

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Dakari: What...?

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Volentina: what

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_

_Emmett sunk a little._

> Emmett: I'll tell you the best looking burgers....

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_

> Wemmfort: Do you guys have any glass shards here?

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:31 PM)_
that's like water but in moldarr

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:32 PM)_

> Volentina: If you really want some, I can get you them.

**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:32 PM)_

> Garrick: Next to you.

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:32 PM)_

> Dakari: Waiter. Do you have any bark?

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:32 PM)_

> Sanya: They're all just leaves. Buy the cheapest, and get a good dressing. You won't even tell the difference.

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Volentina: Tree bark?

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Dakari: Yes

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:33 PM)_
8ball Does Olag suddenly come into the diner butt naked and drunken?

**FFBot** _(18-May-20 04:33 PM)_
Without a doubt :8ball:

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Emmett: Waiter!

**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Garrick: Everyone hide behind their menus.

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Wemmfort: For the food, do you have any dried lava here?

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:33 PM)_

> Volentina: I'd.... have to get back with you on that. Yes?

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Emmett: What's your finest vegetarian thing? I'm looking to stay slim.

_Emmett is pretty fit-looking, despite his shortness._

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:34 PM)_

> Volentina: I'm sure there's some kind of salad here.

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I usually smash the ship's windows for some glass. Glass is hydrating, you know.

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:35 PM)_

_Emmett awkwardly looked at Sanya._

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Emmett: I don't think he's going to be much of a help.

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:35 PM)_

> Dakari: I'll just take a salad as well waiter.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Seth: I'll take two fries, a double mcspelunkers with extra cheese, make that medium rare, a salad with extra fortnite, 2 Medium chocolate milkshakes with a shot of Dwarven rum, sprinkle some Caribeener-19 salt on top, make it turn, spit in it, make it dry, run and stomp on Emmett's foot. I'll also take 2 irish women to-go, a 3 foot 9 midget, you know, like the ones from the circus, cover her in hotsauce, shove 2 peppers up her ass, a stick, a dildo, and 4 dabs of soy sauce. OH! Can I also get uHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.... Fortnite burger, extra farts, 3 packets of Spacemayo, no cum or piss and a large coke.

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I'll share some charred lava with you, goat man.

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Sanya: Waiter. He'll take a garden salad, I'll take... what's the closest you have to goat?

_Sanya glares at Emmett with a sly smile._

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Emmett: Emmett sticks his tongue out at her.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:36 PM)_

> Seth: She'll have a salad.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:36 PM)_

_Seth points at Sanya_

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:37 PM)_
Sanya Smiles at emmett while he's t-posing

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:37 PM)_

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Seth: She needs to lose some weight

_Wink wink_

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Emmett: Sanya wants to bite on some goat meat.

**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:37 PM)_

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:37 PM)_

> Volentina: So. Three salads, some glass shards, charred lava, and whatever he said?

_He looked between the group, looking to the crazed one last as he finished his words._

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Sanya: I will end you. NO, GET ME A STEAK.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Seth: I'll repeat it just in case

**Cooldude** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Wemmfort: I'm so thirsty right now, you don't even know it.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

_Seth breathes in_

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Volentina: no. please don't sir.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Dakari: I want 2 salads actually.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Seth: Shut up.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Seth: We're not rich you know

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_
Volonta would just blankly stare at them.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

> Seth: you get one salad

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:38 PM)_

_Sanya takes the time to look at the waiter, realizing just what she was talking to._

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:39 PM)_

> Dakari: Also do you strawberry milkshakes?

**Rashidi** _(18-May-20 04:39 PM)_

**Lili** _(18-May-20 04:49 PM)_

_Iris wanders around the empty ship, bored out of her mind but with no clue where everyone else is._

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:49 PM)_

_D: Why did you ever choose to join this shitshow of a crew?_

**Preston** _(18-May-20 04:49 PM)_

_Seth goes into the bathroom_

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:54 PM)_

**Trey** _(18-May-20 04:54 PM)_

> Garrick: Everyone's gone to the bathroom, so there's booth space.

**Sean** _(18-May-20 04:54 PM)_

**Zander** _(18-May-20 04:56 PM)_

_Emmett inhales deeply, probably having gotten everyone in the bathroom pretty high. Maybe not Sanya._

**Brody** _(18-May-20 04:56 PM)_
