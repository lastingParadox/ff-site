_Ibraxas opens up the dog's computer compartmment and fastens some loose wires together._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:09 PM)_

> Hmm...

_Ibraxas unscrews some other component and continues working on the dog._

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:09 PM)_

_Ibraxas shocks himself and sticks his finger in his mouth._

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

> Slave labor.

_Seth poses like a Roman Emperor._

**Mr.WobblyShark** _(28-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

_Lodas wakes up in a sweat._

> MONSTER!?

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

> He's an innocent.

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost appears from beneath Lodas's crib, attempting to spook Jim._

> Ahh, you found me hiding spot!

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

> What?

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

> It would be worse to let a witness drift through space than to take one with us.

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost takes out a finger and starts to echo his voice, repeating a single word from Emmett._

> One!

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

> True.

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:11 PM)_

> No witnesses, we'll throw him into the next blackhole.

_Seth takes his holodevice, uninterested in Lodas's life._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:11 PM)_

_Ibraxas looks up at Seth, clearly uncomfortable with his response, but still manages to make light of the situation with a joke._

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:11 PM)_

_Emmett shrugs._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

> Good idea.

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

_Seth looks puzzled, realizing that Emmmett's suggestion was, in a way, darker than his own._

> Reprogramming?

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

> The programming on this dog is sloppy as hell...

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> I know alot about programming, want me to take a look?

_Jim crouches down to Ibraxas, looking at the script being projected from Ibraxas's watch._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> It looks like it was made by a 2 GUY old...

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett get a pink lemonade out of the fridge and chill in the lounge area?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> What do you expect from those who worship a "god emperor"?

\*Seth laughs and puts a friendly arm around Emmett.

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> I got this, Jim.

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> `Robo-Dog`: So what if my owner was a 2 GUY old?

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

> So be it, but if that thing starts shooting rockets out of its ass, it's not on me.

_Jim gets up and backs away from Ibraxas._

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

> Well, about the witness, let's just sell him at the black market for some new body parts!

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost has a Mickey Mouse laugh._

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

_Jim groans in frustration._

> Again, HE IS NOT A ROBOT.

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

> I said I'm taking him to the clinic. End of story.

_Emmett sips his pink lemonade happily._

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

> Shut up slave labor.

_Seth dropkicks his can directly at the Mickey Mouse Ghost and phases through it._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does the dog shut down for reprogramming?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Ask again later, Brakia.

t!8ball Do we arrive at the clinic?

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

_Seth lies his head back, muttering some random topic he learned from early Earth history._

> #Metoo.

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> Seth, you know, because you are mean, I will watch you when you sleep.

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost's eyes glow a menacing red._

_`Robo-Dog`: The robo-dog takes out a cable from the compartment in its lower half and prepares to... inject._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> Oh god.

_Ibraxas tries to get over to the dog to get it to stop._

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> Oh god.

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> Hey, Ibraxas, is there a repair station in the ship?

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> That's hot.

_Seth, being a proud robosexual, is getting a boner from robosex._

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

_`Robo-Dog`: The robo-dog's cord closes in on the game console's USB port._

_`Robo-Dog`: The robo-dog starts to vibrate._

> `Robo-Dog`: WHOOOOOOOYEAH.

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

_Ibraxas sighs and mutters._

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

t!8ball Does Lodas wake up, revert to normal size, and break the cage without issue?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Mr.WobblyShark.

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes, not exactly interested._

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

> Jim.

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

_Lodas turns around with his arms extended, trying to grab at Jim._

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

_Jim runs to his cabin and locks his room._

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> COME HERE YOU LITTLE FILTHY HERETIC!

_Lodas manages to miss grabbing Jim's neck._

_Emmett folds his arms, still pissed about Seth recording his shame._

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

_Jim barricades his door with his body._

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

> Don't forget there are two doors to the washroom...

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost snickers and enters the washroom, hoping to scare someone._

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

_Seth starts to fight over control of the console with Ibraxas and the robo-dog._

> Execute command "abort_deletion_file emmettsfirsttime.mp54!"

**Mr.WobblyShark** _(28-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

> TOUCH THE DOOR, YOU DIE!

_Lodas manages to cut into the door right next to Jim's head._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

> One second!

_Ibraxas shoves Seth aside and tries to type in some characters to cause the command to fail._

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

> `Robo-Dog`: Abort? Like the thirty-four times you looked up 'abortion pill for sale online', Seth?

_`Robo-Dog`: The robo-dog switches the viewport to a list of Seth's search results on the console._

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:24 PM)_

_Jim tries to pick up Lodas._

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:34 PM)_

> At least some female orcs found it hot when the "village hero" broke a few teeth during a fight with alpha orc Gorg-Gana.

t!8ball Does Lodas wake up and continue beating Jim?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 05:35 PM)_

_Emmemt stupidly continues to drink his pink lemonade, the citric acid getting in his wounds._

> Fuck fhis lemonade hurfs...

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 05:36 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:38 PM)_

_Seth heads over to the clinic and butts in in front of Emmett, trying to speak discretely to the receptionist._

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 05:39 PM)_

_`Receptionist`: The receptionist points towards the seats in the waiting room._

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 05:41 PM)_

t!8ball Does Ibraxas get his wrist fixed soon?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 05:41 PM)_

> How long will i have to sit here?

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:42 PM)_

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 05:42 PM)_

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost remains pre-occupied looking at scantily clad pictures of his past wife._

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:42 PM)_

_Jim holds out Lodas, who was struggling._

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:43 PM)_

_`Receptionist`: The receptionist pushes her glasses down to get a better look at Lodas._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:44 PM)_

_Ibraxas tosses the space crab he was given in the wastebin nearby._

> My real wrist is broken.

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:45 PM)_

> `Receptionist`: What do you need him to be checked up on then, human?

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:45 PM)_

_Jim shoves Lodas's head on the counter._

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:45 PM)_

> `Receptionist`: And, other mutant human, we'll fix you up in about an hour and a half.

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:45 PM)_

> Thank you.

_Ibraxas goes to the chairs, sitting next to Emmett._

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:46 PM)_

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:46 PM)_

_`Receptionist`: The receptionist, seemingly an android, glitches, repeating themselves._

_Emmett tries to ignore the pain in his mouth and takes a look over Ibraxas._

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 05:48 PM)_

t!8ball Do all the nurses in the clinic look like a character from the Simpsons?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 05:48 PM)_

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:49 PM)_

_Ibraxas shakes his broken arm slightly._

> If i get it fixed, I can fix my robot one.

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:50 PM)_

> `Receptionist`: By the way, we need to take your metallic items off in order to enter the area.

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:50 PM)_

t!8ball Does the lady take out a twelve pound tub of lubricant and hand it over to Jim?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 05:51 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:51 PM)_

_Seth mutters some command._

> What about "abort_suitsuction"?

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:51 PM)_

t!8ball Does a room open up so that Ibraxas can get medical attention sooner than normal?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 05:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Brakia.

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:52 PM)_

> `Receptionist`: Cyborgs should be fine within the quarters. However, we would need to confiscate any weaponry.

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 05:52 PM)_

> Emmett, you can sleep in your comfy furry arms while waiting!

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost, coincidentally, was lying on Seth's "furry arm" pillow comfortably._

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:53 PM)_

> Ugh.

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:53 PM)_

_`Receptionist`: The receptionist, tired of the newcomers already, decides to give Ibraxas a room that just opened._

> `Receptionist`: Ibraxas? a room is open for you.

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:53 PM)_

> Thank god.

_Ibraxas heads over to the room._

> I'll be back, guys.

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:53 PM)_

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:55 PM)_

_Ibraxas stands up in front of the x-ray machine._

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 05:55 PM)_

_The Mickey Mouse ghost gets bored and enters the clinic to annoy Seth._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(28-Jul-18 05:56 PM)_

_Danny puts down a magazine and looks at all of the crew members in various states of pain._

> Why are you people all banged up?

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:56 PM)_

> Seff...

_Emmett's eyes wander over to Danny._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:56 PM)_

> `Doctor`: Um, Ibraxas. We got your X-ray and... We have no idea what race you are.

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:56 PM)_

> I bit into a helmet stufidly and broke some of my teef.

_Emmett feels his jowl._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:56 PM)_

_Ibraxas shrugs, unfazed from the news._

> Neither do I.

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:56 PM)_

t!8ball Does the woman let the Lodas in because Jim is funny boy?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 05:56 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Bagelwrecker.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(28-Jul-18 05:57 PM)_

> What situation would you be in that you would bite a helmet? That makes no sense.

_Danny looks at Emmett as if he was stupid._

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 05:57 PM)_

> What race am I?

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost revolves around Seth annoyingly._

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:57 PM)_

> I got the space crabs, you want one?

_Seth tosses a space crab at Danny._

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:57 PM)_

_Jim carrys Lodas over to the room that just opened up for them downstairs._

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:57 PM)_

> You're slave labor, shut up.

_Seth tosses a space crab at Emmett._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:58 PM)_

> `Doctor`: Well, lets get you fixed up.

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 05:58 PM)_

> Ok.

_Ibraxas shows his broken arm off apathetically._

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:58 PM)_

_Emmett shrugs, unfazed by Danny's judgmental stare._

> This guy was choking one of my crew memfers. No one else was doing much.

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 05:58 PM)_

> Seth, shut up or I will steal all your honkers!

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost honks, somehow._

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:58 PM)_

t!choose 30 minutes | an hour | 2 hours

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 05:58 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | TheBlade , I pick an hour!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(28-Jul-18 05:58 PM)_

> You people make no sense. Who are you people?

_Danny, although still judgmental, was intrigued by the crew's antics._

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 05:59 PM)_

> Jokes on you, they'll get airlocked either way.

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 05:59 PM)_

> `Brain Surgeon`: Memory wipe will take an hour sir, please carry him this way.

_`Brain Surgeon`: The brain surgeon creepily holds an arm to keep the door open to his chamber._

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 05:59 PM)_

> We're a ragtab crew of bounty hunters.

_Emmett puffs some air out, growing impatient._

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 06:00 PM)_

_`Nurse`: A nurse rushes to the room that Jim, Lodas, and Seth were about to enter and whispers in the brain surgeon's ear._

> `Nurse`: Sorry sir, we cant do anything for you unless you have any physical problems! We're very busy today!

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 06:00 PM)_

> Legal, most of the fime.

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

t!8ball Does the Mickey Mouse Ghost stalk everyone in silence without being noticed?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Tom Thompson.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(28-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

> Yet I've never seen you before. Are you from this area?

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

> Well shit...

_Jim loosens his grip on Lodas, who has given up on trying to escape._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

_`Doctor`: The doctor, after some time, manages to fix up Ibraxas's arm._

> `Doctor`: All right, you're all good.

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

> You know of any mechanics in the area?

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

> Thank you.

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

> We're not from this area. Iff you're askin' about me, I'm a rarity. One f the last squoatlings in the galaxy.

_Emmett sighs._

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost reveals itself to Jim._

> Jim, is Emmett not a mechanic?

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

> `Nurse`: Yes sir, there is a mechanic thirteen leaps that way.

_`Nurse`: The nurse points in a direction, albeit not exactly in a helpful manner._

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett take out a dentistry magazine?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 06:03 PM)_

_Jim walks back to the ground level waiting room with Lodas in his arms._

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 06:03 PM)_

> Nice magazine Emmett, I'll read some of it too...

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost flies behind Emmett, looming over his shoulder._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(28-Jul-18 06:03 PM)_

> I thought the squoatlings were just a legend.

_Danny recalls old news outlets discussing the possibility of the Vortox star system existing, and how he never really believed them._

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 06:03 PM)_

> Some legend...

**Arky** _(28-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does Lucian walk into the waiting room?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Arky.

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

_Emmett swipes at the Mickey Mouse Ghost to get him to buzz off._

> We were wiped out of existence by the Llamanians...

**Arky** _(28-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

> You're all idiots!

_Lucian stomps in, holding his bruised sides from the pirate attack the episode before._

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost remains in place regardless of Emmett's swiping._

> Danny, Emmett has the fluffiest arms ever!

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does Ibraxas join the rest of the crew in the waiting room?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

> I'm back, guys.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(28-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

> That's confusing, what's that voice?

_Danny raises an eyebrow._

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

> It's me!

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost flies about in excitement for finally being acknowledged by someone._

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

_Seth tries to flirt with the receptionist._

> Hey babe, wanna catch a drink later?

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

> A strange ghost we found in Disney Planet.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(28-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

> Follow-up question. How much do you guys make on average? I'm looking to make some quick money.

_Danny smiles at Emmett, attempting to be persuasive._

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> `Receptionist`: Ew, a seven foot tall elf.

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> Wanna know what else is seven feet tall? My cock.

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> We make a good amount here and there...

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> Yea, they are a little disgusting.

_Seth glares daggers at Jim._

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 06:07 PM)_

> Seth, I am going to call the police for rape if you keep this up!

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost giggles evilly._

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 06:07 PM)_

> NO!

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 06:07 PM)_

> Did anyone check on the dog hacking our computers?

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 06:07 PM)_

t!8ball Do I convince the woman to have sex with me in the lobby?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 06:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Bagelwrecker.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(28-Jul-18 06:07 PM)_

> Mind if I join you for at least one mission? Is 10% of the reward good?

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 06:07 PM)_

_Jim scratches the back of his head in embarrassment._

> I uh, I mean, don't do that, we dont want to cause any truble do we?

**Arky** _(28-Jul-18 06:07 PM)_

> Oh calm down ghost, they like it, i think?

_Lucian shrugs._

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

> Wait.. I am wearing a uniform...
> Uh...

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

> Sounds fine. I'm the co-captain of the crew. Fat loser over fhere is Seth.

_Emmett points at the not-so-fat, seven-foot-tall elf._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

> The dog? anyone?

**Platinum_Pathos** _(28-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

> Fat indeed.

_Danny is extremely skinny, so Seth is indeed very fat compared to him._

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> Skinnier than the other people...

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> I stopped the dog by possessing a vacuum. He is no longer watching Seth's history!

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost, in fact, did not do this._

**TheBlade** _(28-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> Don't go chineese on me!

**Arky** _(28-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> What dog? I just woke up.

_Lucian looks at Ibraxas anxiously._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> Okay then...

**Bagelwrecker** _(28-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> Skinnier than the god of skinny.

_Seth poses and holds his breath to look even skinnier than before._

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> Robo-dog with a USB dick.

> He's looking through our search history.

**Arky** _(28-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

> Not gonna ask.

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

_Ibraxas looks away._

> You shouldn't.

**Arky** _(28-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

> Can I kill it?

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

t!8ball Does the dog post Seth's browser history on spacenet?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Tom Thompson.

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 06:11 PM)_

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost takes out its holodevice and looks at Seth's posted browser history, becoming flustered and glowing a light red tint._

> Ohh my god! Seth!
> What do you even watch?!

**Brakia** _(28-Jul-18 06:11 PM)_

> Oh no...

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 06:12 PM)_

t!8ball Does the dog start hacking into the crew's digital Ducketts?

**Tatsumaki** _(28-Jul-18 06:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Zander.

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 06:12 PM)_

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost checks its bank account and notices fraudulent transactions. It assumes that the dog is causing this._

_Ibraxas flips a switch on the dog._

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 06:13 PM)_

_`Robo-Dog`: The robo-dog, having been unplugged from the console, experiences the digital 1's and 0's spewing out of its... "penial chassis" in the form of an oil-like substance._

_`Robo-Dog`: The robo-dog sputters out, having spewed a bit too much._

**Zander** _(28-Jul-18 06:19 PM)_

_`Robo-Dog`: The robo-dog looks at Ibraxas longingly before shutting down, effectively dying._

**Tom Thompson** _(28-Jul-18 06:19 PM)_

> Ibraxas, keep that dog on a leash!

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost pretends to pull on its collar._
