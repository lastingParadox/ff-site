**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

t!8ball Is Emmett resting his cheek on Sanya's flowery head?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Zander.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

_Sanya wakes up and notices Emmett sleeping peacefully atop her shoulders. Annoyed, she shakes her shoulders quickly to try and get him off of her._

> Can sssomeone get thisss guy off me?

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

_From the sudden movement, Emmett wakes up, opening his eyes slowly. The pheremones from Sanya's flower help him stay calm._

> This is pretty comfy...

_Emmett yawns and dozes off again._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:10 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett spend the entire episode on Sanya's back?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:10 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

t!8ball Does Asier get out of bed to join the crew?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

_Asier walks out of his and Garrick's cabin, stretching his body abnormally._

> Wassup' everybody?

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

_Sanya grumbles, annoyed by Emmett's death grip._

> Who are you?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

> The janitor, I guess.

_Asier takes out a vacuum and starts to clean the wrecked lounge from the party last night._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth wake up?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:13 PM)_

_Sanya continues to shake her shoulders._

> Huh. Can you get thisss guy off me?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:13 PM)_

> What is up, my homeslices?

_Seth is in a great mood, coming out in a silky white robe. He heads to the fridge and grabs some more vodka._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:14 PM)_

> He'sss not getting off my back...

_Sanya scowls._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:14 PM)_

> Best sex I had in a while.

_Seth smiles widely._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:14 PM)_

> Yeah sure, I can try.

_Asier puts down the vacuum and takes out his blades._

> Will swords separate you two?

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:15 PM)_

_Sanya has an uncomfortable expression on her face, not really wanting to be sliced up in such a vulnerable position._

> I'm not sssure.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:15 PM)_

_Asier notices her expression and re-holsters the weapons, grabbing some toxic chemicals from the janitor's closet._

> I bet some cleaning product in the eyes will get him off...

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:16 PM)_

_Seth drinks the vodka from the bottle and eyeballs Asier with an intimidating glare._

> Don't kill him.
> Or blind him.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:16 PM)_

> No chemicalsss, pleassse.

_Sanya feels her flower, more worried about it wilting than Emmett's wellbeing._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:16 PM)_

_As Asier takes out his blades again, Seth continues his glare, intimidating Asier into re-holstering his blades._

> Or mortally wound.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:16 PM)_

_Sanya sighs, frustrated._

> Thossse thingsss harm usss...

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:17 PM)_

_Seth puts the carton back in the fridge._

> A little bit of pesticides won't hurt, would it?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:17 PM)_

_Asier folds his arms, anime-style._

> Hmm... Sorry, "not mortally wounding" isn't in my current skill set.

_Asier scoffs, trying to look cool._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:17 PM)_

> Then why are you the janitor?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:17 PM)_

_Asier shrugs._

> Not my decision.
> The dragon made me do it.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:18 PM)_

> Well, dragon dead.

_Seth smirks sinisterly._

> So go eat his body.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:18 PM)_

_Asier stops the cool facade and looks over to Seth in confusion._

> No... thanks?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:18 PM)_

_Seth slams a fist on the kitchen counter._

> You don't get a choice, go clean that body.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:19 PM)_

> It's been there for weeks!

_Asier holds his arms out in commpliant._

> I'm not touching that!

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:19 PM)_

> What dragon are you guysss talking about?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:19 PM)_

_Asier slouches over._

> You know.
> The dead one.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:19 PM)_

_Seth rolls his eyes._

> No, I'm talking about the human dragon thing.
> With the retarded robot arm...

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:19 PM)_

> Yeah, him.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:19 PM)_

_Sanya's confusion subsides._

> Oh, You're talking about Ibraxasss?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:20 PM)_

> Body is in the medic room, go clean it.

_Seth tries to shoo Asier away._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:20 PM)_

> Nope.

_Asier notices Seth and realizes that he could be kicked from the crew by him._

> Yeah ok...
> I suppose.

_Asier walks away in defeat._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(19-Aug-18 02:20 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matthias wake up feeling like a disciple?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(19-Aug-18 02:21 PM)_

_Matthias wakes up in a sweat, having had a dream regarding the Avian god, Kluex, and his pocketwatch fantasy._

> Woah, I feel holy.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:21 PM)_

_Sanya watches Matthias as he enters the lounge._

> Who are you people?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

> Your worst nightmare!

_Asier shrugs._

> Also outlaws.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew set off from the Party Planet?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Reply hazy try again, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew leave the party planet?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Concentrate and ask again, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

t!8ball Please!

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

> Time to get off this planet I've never seen!

_Asier realizes how long he's been asleep, but tries to brush it off as normal._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

> How many more people are on thisss Ssship?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

> I don't know. A lot?

_Asier shrugs and sits on a sofa._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(19-Aug-18 02:27 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matthias all of a sudden start rehearsing all the Commandments of Kluex?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:27 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Enchantingtable2013.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:27 PM)_

> About fifteen.

t!8ball Does Seth drunkenly pilot the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:27 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

_Sanya watches Seth drunkenly stumble to the cockpit, considering Emmett's sleeping._

> Ssseth, ssshould you be driving?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

> Seth, get away from the cockpit you're going to kill us!

_Asier races after Seth._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

> It's my ship, and I'll do what I want!

_Seth takes out a box labeled, "ONE-TIME HACK", and hooks it up to the console. The console lights up green, similar to how it does when Emmett readies up the console. The box fizzles and breaks apart afterwards._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

> I thought it was Emmett's ship!

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

> Incorrect.

_Seth prepares the ship for liftoff, choosing some destination drunkenly._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:29 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya sober Seth up forcefully?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

_Sanya runs to the medbay and manages to find a vial of "SOBE-R-UP!". She races back to cockpit._

> Ssseth, you're going to kill usss all. Come here!

_Sanya lunges at Seth, trying to force him to sip the vial._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

> Fuck off, plant prick!

_Seth attempts to kick her off of him aggressively._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

_Sanya maintains a grip on him, thinking that her flower could knock him out given Emmett's response to it._

> Ssseth, I will ssstab you! Come sssmell my flower!

_Sanya leans into Seth's face, aiming her flower at him._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

> I've piloted many ships drunk before and I'll do it again.

_Seth shoves Sanya away from his face._

> Fuck off, plant prick, I don't wanna get pollinated!

_Seth spits at her to distract her and launches the ship._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

_Sanya wipes her face of the spit, disgusted._

> Sssmell my damn flower before you kill usss all!

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

_Asier comes from the airlock, surprisingly clean despite having "cleaned" the body._

> Okay, the body is cleaned up.

_Asier rolls his eyes in a guilty manner._

> What is happening in here...

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

> Good.

_Seth manages to headbut Sanya off of him._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

_Sanya holds her head, scowling._

> He won't sssober up!

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

> Now Asier, hand me a glass of water. I'm gonna show you guys a trick.

_Seth changes the controls to manual and starts to head the ship towards an asteroid field._

> I call this asteroid hopping!

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

_Asier holds onto the wall as the ship joustles about._

> You're going to spill it everywhere!
> Then I'll have to clean it up!

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

> Nah, that's the trick, you're not supposed to spill it.

_Seth winks at Asier._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya catch Seth by surprise and shove the flower in his face?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, PlasmaPerson.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

_Sanya tries one last attempt to shove her flower in Seth's face to incapacitate him. Seth manages to dodge out of the way and shove her back with more force than before._

> We're going to die!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris wake up now?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

_Iris wakes up from the the ship's joustling causing her to hit her head on the headboard of Seth's bed._

> Ow... my head...

_Iris feels her head, the pain amplified by her hangover. She gets up and joins the others._

> What happened last night, if I may ask?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

> You got a little bit drunk.

_Seth winks._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

> Oh boy, another new face...!

_Asier continues to hold onto the ship._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

> Oh, no...

_Iris struggles to maintain balance._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

> You fell asssleep in Ssseth'sss bed.

_Sanya raises her brow at Iris._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

> Have a cup of water or two.

_Seth points back at the kitchen, trying to get Asier to grab waters._

> I also fell asleep in my bed.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:35 PM)_

_Iris's eyes widen, not remembering much from the night prior._

> Oh, no...

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:35 PM)_

> Not again...

_Asier leaves to get some waters amidst the turmoil._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:36 PM)_

> I am terribly sorry for my behavior last night. I have no idea what I was thinking, drinking with strangers.

_Iris shudders._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:36 PM)_

> It's no problem, you looked like you had fun.

_Seth jumps the ship to another asteroid, "hopping" it to and fro haphazardly._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:36 PM)_

_Asier manages to hand a water to Iris before nearly toppling over from Seth's piloting._

> Well, get used to it. This place is crazy.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:36 PM)_

> Well, it'sss too late to head back now. We've already left...!

_Sanya grips onto the pilot's seat with more strength._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:37 PM)_

> Well I mean, she's homeless so it doesn't matter.

_Seth grabs the other cup from Asier and downs it._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:37 PM)_

> I told you about that?

_Iris grimaces, fearful of what else she told them._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(19-Aug-18 02:37 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matthias start reciting prayers to the Avian god in ten different languages?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Enchantingtable2013.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:37 PM)_

_Asier curses in the Spectre language under his breath._

> Â¬

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:37 PM)_

> Yep...

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

> I... am so incredibly sorry.

_Iris holds herself._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth take a Sleep-B-Gone pill?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Bagelwrecker.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

_Asier continues to swear, some of his words being translated properly._

> Thotbegone.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

> It's no problem.

_Seth shrugs and aims the ship at another asteroid, jostling everyone around._

> You seemed pretty happy when you entered the bone zone.

_Seth wiggles his eyebrows inappropriately._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:39 PM)_

> I-I'm sorry, what?!

_Like a cartoon, Iris's hair flares out in all directions in surprise._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:39 PM)_

_Seth licks his lips, not caring about where the ship is headed._

> B-O-N-E Z-O-N-E!

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:40 PM)_

_Asier balls up his fists, trying not to show his disgust._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:40 PM)_

_Iris's cheeks becomme rosy in embarassmment._

> Excuse me while I go eject myself from the ship...

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:40 PM)_

_Asier sighs and unclenches his fists, watching Iris walk by._

> Bye, stranger.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:40 PM)_

_Seth gets up, letting up on the asteroid hopping. He sets the ship to automaatic flight for the time being._

> I can do that for you if you want.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:40 PM)_

_Garrick exits his cabin, seeing Iris walk by._

> Heyo.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:40 PM)_

> I'm joking of course.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

> Yo'.

_Asier snaps his fingers at Garrick._

> Fellow phantom.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

_Seth gives an evil-sounding laugh as Iris entered the airlock room, seeing tons of clothes, booze, and valuable strewn about from airlocked partygoers._

> I broke the airlock button last night.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

_Asier scoffs, speaking in his Spectre tongue once more at this revelation._

> à¸¯

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

> Hey, you're someone I haven't seen before.

_Garrick looks for his foam finger but isn't able to find it._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

_Finally, Emmett wakes up from Sanya's wobbling, maintaining his grip on her._

> ... Huh?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

> Ya' know Iris, letting loose can be fun...

_Seth puts his hands on his hips._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

> On this ship, there's always someone we haven't seen.

_Asier smiles at Garrick._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

_Emmett is still woozy from the events of the night prior._

> Is the ship moving or is the universe moving for us?

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

> We're moving...

_Sanya tries to shake Emmett off, having nearly forgotten about him._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

_Garrick finds a fridge letter magnet instead of his foam finger and shoves it in Asier's face._

> D!

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

> Can you get me over to the control pad?

_Emmett yawns._

> I just had some wild vision.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:44 PM)_

> Yes, but I am certain I gave a terrible first impression by acting like an overgrown child...

_Iris looks away._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:44 PM)_

> Or I could be high...

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:44 PM)_

> Can't you jussst hop off my back?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:44 PM)_

_Asier tries to pull Emmett off of Sanya._

> Nah, he's thoroughly stuck.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:44 PM)_

_Emmett tries to get off of Sanya, but his legs seemed to be attached to her._

> I can't move my legs.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:44 PM)_

> I enjoyed your first impression, Iris.

_Seth gives a slight smile._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:44 PM)_

> What?!

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:44 PM)_

> I thought you were pretty cool.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

_Emmett could move his legs a little, but he is still woozy from drinking earlier._

> I think I'm paralyzed...

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

_Garrick rolls his eyes, just realizing what Seth meant._

> Yeah, I'm sure you did, Seth.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> Oh no...

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> I cannot remember anything from last night.

_Iris gives an uncomfortable half-smile._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> Good.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> I would not call that a good first impression...

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

_Asier tries to pull Emmett away from Sanya and notices an adhesive connecting his legs to her waist._

> Alright, who got into the tile glue while I was gone and glued Emmett to Sanya?

_Emmett and Sanya sigh in relief._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> Did... did I do that?

_Iris's whole world was shattering._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> I'll do a little recap. We did a little dancing, we talked, we had sex and then we slept.

_Seth laughs heartily, clutching Iris's shoulder like a dear friend._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

> Here, I'll move to the keypad.

_Sanya sits in the pilot's seat._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

> Ah, that's not so-

_Iris backs away fromm Seth in terror._

> Wait, I'm sorry, we did WHAT EXACTLY?!

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

> Alright. Here's my password.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

> We did a little dancing, we talked, we had sex and then we slept.

_Seth shrugs, confused by Iris's reaction._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett whisper his password to Sanya?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Zander.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

> You have rapid mood swings when you're drunk.
> Just thought I'd let you know.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:47 PM)_

_Iris pauses for a while and shivers._

> That is precisely why I do not normally drink.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:47 PM)_

> Don't worry, I'm not married so you don't have any competition.

_Seth winks._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:47 PM)_

_Emmett whispers his referential password to Sanya._

> F-A-T-H-E-R-\_-B-U-T-T-E-R-S.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:47 PM)_

_Iris folds her arms and scoffs._

> And I have just decided that I am no longer going to allow myself to consume alcohol, ever again.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:47 PM)_

_Sanya raises her brow in confusion._

> I'm sssorry?

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:47 PM)_

_Garrick frowns at Iris's conclusion._

> I don't...

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:47 PM)_

> Aw, no fun.
> Well, that's fine. There's other ways we can chill.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:48 PM)_

> Type that in.

_Emmett points at the console._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:48 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya type the password in?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:48 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:48 PM)_

_As Sanya submits the password, the console flickers from green to yellow and then back to green, recognizing Emmett's configuration._

> ...Okay, I did it.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:49 PM)_

> Send us to Glorap Prime.

_Emmett points at the closest planet on the sensors._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:49 PM)_

_Seth's guilt starts to settle in._

> If you want, we can do another first impression if that'll make you feel better?

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:49 PM)_

> Yes please, that would be delightful.

_Iris takes a deep breath and shakes her head. She curtsies to Seth and takes out a hand._

> Hello. My name is Iris. And yours?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

> Hello Iris, pleasure to meet you.

_Seth grabs Iris's hand just like before and kisses it._

> I'm Seth.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

> Alright, the coordinatesss are in...

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

_Asier waves at Iris._

> I'm not Seth!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

> Pleased to meet you, Seth.

_Iris giggles at Asier's response._

> And you, not Seth.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

> I'm Casper.

_Garrick gives a wide, fake smile._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

> Hello, Casper. I am Iris.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

> Haha, bet you'd never think of that.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

_Asier leans towards Iris and points towards the kleptomaniac ghost._

> No, he's Garlic.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:51 PM)_

_Seth gives a suggestive, prideful pose._

> I'm a space captain on the HMS Bone Zone.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:51 PM)_

> Is he Casper or is he Garlic?

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:51 PM)_

> I'm Garrick.

_Garrick finds his foam finger and points it to Asier's dumb smile._

> ASIER.
> More like... uh...
> Gaysier.

_Garrick shrugs._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:51 PM)_

_Sanya yells loudly, having overheard the conversation from the cockpit._

> He'ss a pain in the assss, that'sss what he isss!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:51 PM)_

> But I thought you said you were Casper?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:52 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick legally change his name to Casper for precisely 27 minutes?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, PlasmaPerson.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:52 PM)_

> Oh, shut up, you overgrown weed!

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:52 PM)_

> Jeez' guys, such great first impressions you are having on our guests.

_Seth groans and leads the others back to the cockpit from the airlock._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:52 PM)_

> And your name?

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:52 PM)_

_Emmett rests his chin on Sanya's leaves again, muttering some nonsense to himself._

> Only you can prevent forest fires...

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:52 PM)_

_Sanya looks over to Iris with an annoyed expression._

> I'm Sssanya.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:53 PM)_

> Charmed, Sanya.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:53 PM)_

> I'm Emmett, by the way.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:53 PM)_

> Asss am I.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:53 PM)_

> Janitorism messed me up.
> You have no idea the horrors I have seen!
> The bathrooms after Taco Tuesday...

_Asier shudders as if he's done a lot of janitorial work willingly in the past._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:53 PM)_

> A pleasure to meet you, Emmett.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:54 PM)_

_Asier glances over to Garrick, who is trying to pickpocket Seth. He snaps at him in his Spectre tongue._

> Î¼Â§Ð“

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:54 PM)_

_Garrick is taken aback from being caught and responds._

> Â§Â«Â¿â€˜Ä‡ÃŸâ€¢Â¥

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

_Iris watches the two spectres in bewilderment._

> Is this Binary?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

_Asier sighs and gives Garrick a thumbs down._

> Â¥Î©Â¤

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

> No.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

> Just ignore the ghosts.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

> Oh...

_Asier frowns._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

> Ghossstsss are ssstupid.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

_Garrick puts his hands on his sides and sticks his tongue out._

> Yeah, well I can go through walls.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

_Asier chuckles sinisterly._

> At least we won't burn with a match.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris think ghosts are stupid?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Jelsafan0.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:56 PM)_

> Anyways, would you like to dance?

_Seth holds out his hand._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:56 PM)_

> Indeed.

_Iris follows, grabbing Seth's hand._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:56 PM)_

_Emmett grumbles._

> I think only Sanya and I could burn with a match, to be honest.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:56 PM)_

> I.... do not like fire.

_As she dances, Iris has a grim expression._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:56 PM)_

> Oh yeah, "Garlic"? Well at leassst I can actually pick objects up. With my CORPOREAL handsss.

_Sanya flashes her hands._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:56 PM)_

> Â£$$Â©Â§

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:57 PM)_

_Emmett takes a large whiff of Sanya's flower and chuckles at her demeanor._

> You're pretty funny, you know that?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:57 PM)_

> I can do that. Garlic can't.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:57 PM)_

> Yeah, well I bet you can't fit an entire machine gun in your pockets.

_Garrick takes out a balloon submachine gun from his pockets._

> That's unrelated to the ghost thing.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:57 PM)_

> Oh, burn!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:57 PM)_

> I... am confused. Is his name Garlic or Garrick?

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:57 PM)_

> Heheh. Burn.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:57 PM)_

_Sanya looks angrily at Garrick, ignoring his balloon._

> YOU CAN'T PICK UP A MACHINE GUN!

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:57 PM)_

> YES I CAN!

_Garrick waves the balloon gun around._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:57 PM)_

> Wait, you can?

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:58 PM)_

_Emmett raises his head from Sanya's._

> Is my body being a burden right now?

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:58 PM)_

_Sanya reveals her claws._

> YOUR HANDSSS AREN'T CORPOREAL!

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:58 PM)_

> I'm just curious...

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 02:58 PM)_

> I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS, ALRIGHT??

_Garrick drops the balloon gun._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 02:58 PM)_

_Sanya smacks Emmett's cheek gingerly to get him to be quiet._

> Yess. Yess you are.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 02:58 PM)_

> Dude I've known you for like four days and I never knew this?

_Asier has no concept of time._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:58 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth do the waltz with Iris to distract her from the arguing crew?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 02:58 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 02:59 PM)_

> You can drop me if you want...

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 02:59 PM)_

_Seth spins Iris around as she tries to understand Garrick's true name._

> I am... incredibly confused...

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 02:59 PM)_

> Don't worry, they're a little silly.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:00 PM)_

_Garrick is uncharacteristically angry over their conversation and screams._

> E!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:00 PM)_

> Ah, that does make sense. So, if I am understanding the situation correctly, you have essentially kidnapped me?

_Iris continues to dance dispite this revelation._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:00 PM)_

_Asier points at Seth._

> You!

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:00 PM)_

> Yesss, we have.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:00 PM)_

> I mean no, but yes.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:01 PM)_

_Seth lets go of Iris and smiles, satisfied with her dancing ability._

> I mean, if you want we can drop you back off at the party planet.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:01 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick do absolutely nothing at all?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:01 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, RPretribution.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:02 PM)_

> But I didn't feel it would be right to leave a drunk girl at a party by herself...

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:02 PM)_

t!8ball Can Emmett move his fingers?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Zander.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:02 PM)_

> Hey, Emmett, are you ok?

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:02 PM)_

_Emmett's body starts to lock up, possibly from some drugs that were dipped into his concoction at the party._

> Not really.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:03 PM)_

> No thank you. I would very much prefer it if I were never to return to that planet...

_Iris grimaces._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:03 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya break the 8ball's rules and drop Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:03 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:03 PM)_

> Sounds good, then for the time being you can join the crew.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:03 PM)_

> I feel sick...

_Emmett pauses to make sure he doesn't puke on Sanya's head._

> Again.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:03 PM)_

_Sanya tries desperately to get Emmett off of her._

> Can someone help usss?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett get off of Sanya now but also the ship lands?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, PlasmaPerson.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:05 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris take Emmett off of Sanya's back?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:05 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Jelsafan0.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:05 PM)_

_Iris warms up her hands and applies them to the tile glue, melting it away._

> Thank you.

_Iris helps Emmett off of Sanya._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:06 PM)_

> You seemed rather upset.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:06 PM)_

_Emmett tries to move, but is unable to. He spits on the floor, definitely feeling some nausea from whatever drugs he consumed at the party._

> I literally can't move my body.
> So thanks...

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:06 PM)_

> But now he's just stuck there.
> Can you roll around?

_Garrick circles his finger as if Emmett was a dog._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:06 PM)_

> Have fun with that.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:06 PM)_

> He wasss ssstuck on my back. Ssso I guesss thisss isss better.

_Sanya shrugs._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:07 PM)_

> By "I can't move my body" I can't move. At all.
> Well, I guess I can move my face...

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:07 PM)_

> What if I move your body?

_Garrick smiles mischievously._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:07 PM)_

> My apologies. Should I not have removed you?

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:07 PM)_

> Out of the ship?
> Permanently?

_Emmett rolls his eyes, not finding Garrick's joke funny._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:07 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth put Emmett in his backpack?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Bagelwrecker.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:08 PM)_

> Nice backpack.

_Garrick gives a thumbs up._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:08 PM)_

_Emmett sighs._

> This is violating my personal space.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:08 PM)_

> Perfect, now he's like C-3PO-PO-3-C, from the hit movie, Star Wars Wars Star!

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:08 PM)_

> Would you rather be in my pockets?

_Garrick continues to give a suspicious smile._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:08 PM)_

_Sanya folds her arms in satisfaction._

> Now you know how I felt.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:08 PM)_

_Garrick's face drops._

> The answer is no.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:08 PM)_

> That is a lovely backpack. I like it.

_Iris admires Seth's beautiful canvas bag._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:08 PM)_

_Garrick smells his pocket and gives a vile cartoon expression._

> It smells in there.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:08 PM)_

_Asier notices that the ship has been landed for a while now and decides to leave the cockpit._

> I'm going without you guys if you don't hurry up.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:09 PM)_

> Alright, we'll do this like we did when I rescued you.

_Seth pats Emmett on the head to his chagrin and leaves to exit the ship._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:09 PM)_

> Fine, let's go.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:09 PM)_

> Where are we going?

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:09 PM)_

> I was like four feet tall when you did this...

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:09 PM)_

> Outside!

_Asier opens up the ship hatch._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:09 PM)_

_Garrick glares at Emmett._

> Hey, what's wrong with being four feet tall?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:09 PM)_

> You only grew like a foot, you'll be fine.

_Seth looks around the environment the crew landed in._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:10 PM)_

> What are we doing, exactly?

_Iris rubs her eyes from the light outside._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:11 PM)_

> We're going on a mission, you want to join us?

_Seth jumps off the ship, jostling Emmett around._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:11 PM)_

> Let's just get going...

> Into the temple.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:11 PM)_

_Seth turns around, motioning Iris to follow him._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:11 PM)_

> Mission?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:12 PM)_

> Yeah, we're bounty hunters.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:12 PM)_

> What missssion are we doing?

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:12 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick get out of the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, RPretribution.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:12 PM)_

> Ah! That sounds fun.

_Iris walks down the ramp, out of the ship._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:12 PM)_

t!8ball does garrick get out of the ship, in an epic style?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, RPretribution.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:13 PM)_

> There's a lot of lube in here. Makes me uncomfortable to see what else is...

_Emmett tries to shift around unsuccessfully._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:13 PM)_

> What?

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:13 PM)_

> That...

_Iris shudders at the thought of what else Seth could have in his pack._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:13 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett eventually start moving again?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Cannot predict now, Zander.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:14 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett eventually start moving again in a few minutes?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Zander.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:15 PM)_

_Asier, sees a bird in the distance and speaks in his Spectre tongue._

> Â¥@nnÂ¥ L@Î¼Ð“@L

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:15 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew get out of the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Brakia.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:15 PM)_

_Garrick slaps Asier on the back of the head for his comment at the bird._

> $@&"Â¡Å’ÃŸ|

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew make it inside the temple?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:16 PM)_

> Alright, we're here!

_Asier holds his arms out excitedly._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:16 PM)_

_Emmett mutters to himself._

> Just watch Kambras or Maia come in here and see me in this state. Sheesh...

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:16 PM)_

> This has been... very interesting...

_Iris coughs as the crew enters the temple, dust rising into her face._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:17 PM)_

_It appears that Garrick and Asier continue to speak to one another in their Spectral tongue._

> Ã»Ñ’Ã®â€  â€ âˆšÂ¢kâ€ 

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:17 PM)_

> Ssso, what are we trying to find?

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris accidentally set a small wooden object on fire?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

_Emmett sniffles._

> Some jewel.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

_Iris manages to light a wooden bench ablaze by accident, freaking her out._

> AH!

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

> We're replacing the shitty Walt Disney one for it...

_Emmett looks around, hoping the Mickey Mouse Ghost isn't around to hear this._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

> Don't set anything on fire, you might kill Sanya.

_Garrick giggles to himself._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett start to sing the American Dad theme and then proceed to get smited by American dad Empire?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Bagelwrecker.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

> On second thought...

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

_Emmett, bored, decies to sing a catchy song from a commercial he saw recently, which just happened to be the American Dad Empire's song. Using their extreme communications array, the ADE catches this and shoots Emmett with a great electric shock._

> I am fucked...

_Emmett regains the ability to move his arms despite his shocking punishment._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

_Iris jumps back from the fire._

> Fire!!! EEP!

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:19 PM)_

> Ssshit, Ssstuff'sss on fire!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:19 PM)_

> AHHHHHH!!!

_Iris runs around cartoonishly._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:19 PM)_

_Seth points at Asier aggressively._

> Fix it!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:19 PM)_

> I AM VERY AFRAID OF FIRE!!

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:20 PM)_

_Asier produces a fire extinguisher and extinguishes the fire._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:20 PM)_

_Emmett furrows his brow in anger._

> I think the American Dad Empire striked me with a case of bullshit.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:20 PM)_

> Problem solved!

_Asier claps._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:20 PM)_

> That happens a lot to you.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:20 PM)_

_Iris holds herself and bows apologetically._

> I am very sorry for my clumsiness.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:20 PM)_

> Like, I feel better now but I definitely do not know the lyrics to its anthem...

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does KYL300's bounty hunting group emerge from a hallway?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, ProfessorTree.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

> I think they randomly selected someone in its vicinity for weapons testing or something...

_Emmett is about to leave Seth's pack until he notices the other crew emerge._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

_Sanya mutters sarcastically, still going on about the fire._

> I could have died.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

_Iris quivers, not knowing whether to take Sanya seriously._

> I am very sorry, Sanya! I am so sorry!

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

> What--

_Asier jumps, startled by the other crew's presence._

> Attackers!?

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

_Iris obliviously continues to talk about the fire._

> At least it was not started with my powers?

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

_The KYL unit emerges from the hall, pointing its blade at the crew._

> FREEZE!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:22 PM)_

> It could have killed us all if that were the case...

_Iris finally leaves the past and is startled from the sudden appearance of the KYL unit._

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 03:22 PM)_

> `KYL Crewmember`: Look at that, we've got visitors!

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:22 PM)_

> Everyone, Get Down!

_Sanya uncharacteristically drops, having been effectively caught with her pants down._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett successfully pirouette out of the backpack as KYL300 comes in?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:22 PM)_

> Oh! Unfortunately, I do not have any ice with me at the moment!

_Iris shrugs, trying to be humorous._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:22 PM)_

_Asier pulls out a blade in one hand and his whip in the other._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:23 PM)_

_Emmett hands on his backhooves from his pirouette, his gracefulness giving him an intimidating stature._

> You freeze, robo-trash.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:23 PM)_

_Iris looks around at Asier, Emmett, and KYL300 nervously._

> Oh, okay!

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 03:23 PM)_

_Without skipping a beat, the KYL unit changes its armblade to an arm blaster._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:23 PM)_

> Uh oh...

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:23 PM)_

> That... does not look good...

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:23 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya run at the attackers and use her real good stabs?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Better not tell you now, Brakia.

_Emmett, despite not having a weapon on hand, counts the members in their opposition's crew._

> Y'know, I think we outnumber you guys.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:23 PM)_

_Garrick takes out a mace from his pocket and flails it about unskillfully._

> Nice, a weapon.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:24 PM)_

> I do not believe I would turn into space dust if I were to die...

_Iris frowns._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:24 PM)_

_Emmett grabs at his back, where his crossbow would be holstered, only to realize he left it on the ship._

_Iris shrugs._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:24 PM)_

_From Iris's comment, Garrick gets existential, looking at his hands in distress._

> Can I even die?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:24 PM)_

_Seth breathes deeply, puffs out his chest, and points directly at the KYL unit._

> I enact Space Rule 35.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:24 PM)_

> Anyways, where were we...

_Garrick gasps at the mention of Space Rule 35._

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 03:24 PM)_

_KYL300 holds up its blaster, away from the crew._

> Ah, a duel, you say?

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

> That... does not sound good...

_Iris frowns._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

_Seth smiles widely, speaking with charismatic pride._

> Emmett! Prepare my blaster!

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

> What do you guys think?

_The KYL unit looks to its crew members, who seem to agree with the notion of a duel to the death._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

> Please do not die...

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

> I'm a quick shot.

_Seth points finger guns at KYL300 and pretends to shoot them._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

_Emmett grumbles as he heads back to grab Seth's dual laser pistols and "duelling lube"._

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

> `KYL Crewmember`: Yeah, you can take 'em.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

> I'll be the referee, I guess.

_Emmett comes back from the ship with Seth's guns, a tub of cherry sex jelly, a couple of medical supplies, and a set of Space Rule 35 duelling flags._

> I'll lube up your gun...

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

> I am very seriously asking you to please not die.

_Iris quivers, biting her nails in anticipation._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

> I'll be safe.

_Seth bangs on his chest in a masculine manner._

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 03:26 PM)_

_The KYL unit starts powering its arm cannon up._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:26 PM)_

_Sanya pummps her fists in the air in excitement._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:26 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:26 PM)_

> Of course.

_Seth winks at his captive audience._

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 03:26 PM)_

_KYL changes its left arm into a shield, provoking Seth to express his disgust._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:26 PM)_

> That's gay.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 03:26 PM)_

> Oh, I'm so hurt.

_The KYL unit holds its chest, mocking Seth._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:27 PM)_

_Seth furiously mocks the KYL unit in return._

> oH, iM sO hUrT!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:27 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:29 PM)_

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:29 PM)_

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:29 PM)_

_Emmett begrudgingly dips Seth's laser pistols into the cherry lube and makes sure to get the barrel extra-lubed up._

> Alright.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:29 PM)_

_Seth holds his hands out for his pistols, which Emmett hands over._

> Thank you Emmett.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:30 PM)_

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 03:30 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:30 PM)_

> You ready to die robo-bastard?

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:30 PM)_

_Garrick shakes his head, having misheard Seth's insult as something much, much more offensive than what's allowed in this archive._

> Oh!

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:30 PM)_

> So, the next time I say "Go", you two fight. No interferences, no asking for your Squomma.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 03:30 PM)_

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:31 PM)_

_Emmett interrupts the KYL unit's speech._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 03:31 PM)_

_Emmett, having not realized Seth's shot, waves the flags like a true referee._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:31 PM)_

_Seth blows his pistols, thinking he took out the robot._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:51 PM)_

_Emmett pops up for a second, staring into KYL's cold, dead sensors._

> He's literally going to die!

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:51 PM)_

_Garrick, noticing how Seth is on the brink of death, heads over to Emmett's nest area and grabs some sprays to help heal the elf._

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky grabs the butt of his flaregun and bashes Iris across the face with it._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:52 PM)_

_Seth's breathing is raspy and heavy. He's lying on the ground, coughing out blood from his broken ribs and cheekbone._

> Of course not! E-Even if I die, I'll seduce the death goddess and she'll let me out!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:52 PM)_

_Iris feels her face where Chommsky bashed it and glares at him with a fiery passion._

_Garrick cheers Iris on._

> Do it! Get him!

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 03:53 PM)_

_Just as the KYL unit readies a killing blow on Seth, it takes the brunt of the blast. KYL300 is missing its left arm and much of its internal systems are running awry due to denting and fraying of wires._

> SHIT-!

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 03:53 PM)_

_Emmett, despite protecting his father, feels shitty for breaking Space Rule 35._

> I am a piece of shit...

_Emmett smiles over to Seth, who is able to muster a smile back._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:53 PM)_

_KYL300 lies on the ground, expelling a black viscous fluid akin to oil from various components in its chassis._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:53 PM)_

_Iris charges a flaming fist and smacks the distraught Chomsky._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 03:54 PM)_

_Seth coughs violently and stands._

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 03:56 PM)_

_KYL300 weakly reaches out to Chomsky._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 03:56 PM)_

_Garrick's face opens and closes similarly to Pac-Man._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 03:56 PM)_

_Iris tries to land another hit on Chomsky, who manages to dodge her attack._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 03:57 PM)_

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky groans at his leader's state and digs in his pockets for some pills, figuring that they would help patch up KYL, somehow._

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 03:57 PM)_

_KYL300 walks towards Seth, ready to fight once more._

_The KYL unit disguises itself as Seth, having a couple of tricks up its own sleeve._

_Sanya shields herself from Seth's aggressive bash._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:07 PM)_

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky, having patched the stab in his shoulder, tries to torch the marshmallow. He manages to miss it and miss both Sanya and Seth, somehow._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 04:07 PM)_

_Seth rolls his eyes, trying to keep the fake Seth alive, for some reason._

> Damnit.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:19 PM)_

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky peers around the corner, fearful of being attacked by Iris._

> `Chomsky`: KYLE, GET OUT OF HERE!

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:19 PM)_

> I want you to come and chill. It is literal chaos out there...

_Emmett's face wavers as he wants someone to talk with._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:19 PM)_

> Emmett, put real cologne on my to do list!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:20 PM)_

> Chomsky, which one is Kyle?

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:20 PM)_

> Go on! Run along with your crazy partner!

_The fake Seth shoos Seth away._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:20 PM)_

> Eugh, why did I think this was a good idea. I'm outta here.

_As the two Seths enter the restroom, Garrick leaves KYL's body, shivering from the cold and metallic chassis he inhabited._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 04:20 PM)_

> Alright. It wasss pretty crazy out there. will they be okay though?

_Sanya folds her arms as she and Emmett head back to the kitchen._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:20 PM)_

> I'm sure.

_Emmett gives Sanya a smile._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:20 PM)_

> `Chomsky`: Why would I say?!

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky glares at Iris._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:20 PM)_

t!8ball Do Seth and KYL300 walk over to the urinals and take a piss?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 04:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, Bagelwrecker.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:20 PM)_

> I mean, yeah...

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:20 PM)_

> So, how's your day been?

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:20 PM)_

> Because I asked?

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:20 PM)_

> Want me to get you off the American Dad Empires's wanted list?

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:21 PM)_

> Pretty weird, I guess.

_KYL "pisses" really high and low repeatedly._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:21 PM)_

> Who, me?

_Iris then realizes she wasn't being spoken to._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 04:21 PM)_

> Why not...

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:21 PM)_

> Mine too.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:21 PM)_

> Jeez, fake Seth. How do you live with gears as your insides like that?

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:21 PM)_

> Alright...

_Emmett looks into the ADE's wanted list, managing to hack in. He takes off the crew's names from their list._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:21 PM)_

> You're an amazing piece of technology man, it's amazing how you can disguise yourself.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:22 PM)_

_Iris shakes her head and points her fists to Chomsky._

> Wait, weren't we supposed to be fighting?

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:22 PM)_

> Right back at you.

_KYL winks at Seth._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:22 PM)_

> I don't know.

_Garrick "shrugs._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:22 PM)_

> You got any grass on you?

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does Kyle download information about Seth quietly?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 04:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, ProfessorTree.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:22 PM)_

> I need a smoke real quick.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:23 PM)_

> Sorry, no. I think Emmett stole all of mine.

_KYL shrugs._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:23 PM)_

_Seth chuckles._

> Damn, he does that too often.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:23 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick whack KYL300 on the head with a rock?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 04:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, RPretribution.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:23 PM)_

> You wanna chill for a little bit before we go out and fight?

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:23 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett start making lunch for everyone?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 04:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Zander.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:23 PM)_

_Garrick grabs a rock, phases into the wall of the restroom, and smacks the KYL unit in the head with it._

> EAT ROCKS!
> Please.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:23 PM)_

_The KYL unit remains unfazed from Garrick's attack, focused on downloading Seth's data._

> Yeah, sounds good.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 04:24 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya eat the Marshmallow?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 04:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:24 PM)_

> I mean, one of us is going to die, so we might as well chill for a little.

_Seth chuckles._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:24 PM)_

> So, uh... Chomsky, right?

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:24 PM)_

> Right.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:24 PM)_

`Chomsky`: t!choose Chomsky runs away | Chomsky continues to fight

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 04:24 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | PlasmaPerson, I pick Chomsky continues to fight!

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:25 PM)_

_Seth takes out his holodevice and accesses a bookmark on his browser._

> You see this video of the girl sucking the Flarporpians tentacles?

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:25 PM)_

> Bet all this disguising is running your power down, huh?

_The fake Seth is taken aback from how grotesque the video he was being shown was._

> Oh, my.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:25 PM)_

> Fucking hilarious, man!

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:25 PM)_

> This makes me hard...

_The KYL unit holds its crotch._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:25 PM)_

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky grunts in pain._

> `Chomsky`: Yes.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:25 PM)_

_Seth raises an eyebrow at the fake Seth, as if he's trying to decipher whether he's a real Seth._

> I don't care much for tentacle porn to be honest.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:26 PM)_

_Emmett takes out some sandwich and burger ingredients for the two crews, considering that it seems everyone is starting to set aside their differences._

> Sanya, I haven't really gotten to know you much.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:26 PM)_

> Just the lady is what's getting me...

_The fake Seth, having not been completely disguised, starts getting a massive boner._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:26 PM)_

_Iris takes out her hand to Chomsky._

> A pleasure to meet you.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:26 PM)_

> Yeah you're right.

_As if on cue, the real Seth starts getting a massive boner as well._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 04:26 PM)_

> I've only been here for a day or ssso...

_Sanya shrugs._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:26 PM)_

_Garrick's whole body rumbles._

> I'm hungry, actually.

_Garrick heads back to the ship._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:26 PM)_

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky shakes Iris's hand._

> `Chomsky`: Under the circumstances, no. It's not.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:26 PM)_

_Seth yells into his comms._

> Hey, Emmett make us two burgers!

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:27 PM)_

> What do you like to eat?

_Emmett peers over Sanya, assuming she liked something meat-based._

> And you too, Garrick. What do you even eat?

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:27 PM)_

> Just... food.
> Ghosts don't have a specific diet.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:27 PM)_

> I suppose you're right. I'm fairly new to this group, so I'm still unsure how to act... ever.

_Iris gives a nervous smile._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:27 PM)_

> With everything on it.

_Seth remembers his favorite burger. Emmett scoffs at the suggestion of having to get materials such as nuclear waste, "a piece of food", and a scab._

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 04:27 PM)_

> I eat raw flesh. Well, that's my primary sssource of food.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:28 PM)_

_The KYL unit manages to hack into the crew's comms system._

> Same here.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:28 PM)_

> Alright, lets head out there.

_Seth waves his arm back out the door and opens the restroom door for the KYL unit._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:28 PM)_

> But Seth isn't new...?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:28 PM)_

> Go ahead and disguise now.

_Seth smiles._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:29 PM)_

> `Chomsky`: Seth?

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky watches the two Seths come out, of which the fake Seth had already completely disguised at this point._

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:29 PM)_

> Alright. You're a pretty cool guy, you know.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:29 PM)_

_Emmett looks at Sanya weirdly, remembering some sort of vampire he once met._

> That reminds me of this one person I met that sucked on their friends' shoulders for a snack...

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:29 PM)_

> `Chomsky`: Who's that?

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:29 PM)_

> I might consider sparing you if it comes down to it.

_The fake Seth winks at Seth, the two in their own little world._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:29 PM)_

_Iris points to the two Seths weakly._

> Seth. You know, the one who suddenly became two.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:29 PM)_

> They didn't cause any harm except for a hickey...

_Emmett looks up, puzzled, trying to determine whether what he remembered was the whole story about that fellow._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:29 PM)_

> I try to be respectful to my opponents.

_Seth takes out his fists._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:29 PM)_

> `Chomsky`: Ah. Right.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 04:29 PM)_

> Really? huh.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:29 PM)_

> No reason to be a douche to the guy you might be killing later.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:29 PM)_

> Right?

_Fake Seth doles out his fists as well._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:30 PM)_

> That's fair.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:30 PM)_

> I mean, in battle it's different.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:30 PM)_

> Yes. My name is Iris, by the way.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:30 PM)_

> They tried sucking on my neck too, but I thought it was a little awkward...

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:30 PM)_

_`Chomsky`: Iris and Chomsky had been holding hands for a while, but Iris hadn't helped him get up just yet._

> `Chomsky`: ... Help me up.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:30 PM)_

> But like outside of battle, nah, it's just not worth being a cockhead.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:30 PM)_

> True.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:30 PM)_

> I'm unsure if that's wise.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:30 PM)_

_Emmett takes out some raw meat the crew ordered._

> Here. Some SpaceHub ground meat.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:30 PM)_

> But...

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:30 PM)_

> Now that I think about it...

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 04:30 PM)_

> Thanksss.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:31 PM)_

> You got the grill all set up Emmett or do you need help?

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:31 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris help Chomsky up?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 04:31 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Jelsafan0.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:31 PM)_

_KYL puts down its fists._

> What's the point of one of us dying? You took out all my guys, 'cept Chomsky.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:31 PM)_

> Chomsky seems cool, I guess.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:31 PM)_

> I'm getting the grill set up...

_Emmett groans and heads to the ship's hatch, grabbing the pop-out grill._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:31 PM)_

> You know, you're right.

_Seth sighs in relief and holsters his mean hands._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:31 PM)_

> Sure.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:31 PM)_

> I liked the other guy better...

_Garrick looks around for Asier, trying to find him amidst the rubble of the ruins. After a couple seconds, he looks to the ground solemnly, but then regains his composure._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:31 PM)_

> You wanna agree to not fight?

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:31 PM)_

> It seems like it'd be beneficial for us all if we joined together.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:32 PM)_

> I think so too, let's discuss it over a meal then.
> Unless you can't eat.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:32 PM)_

> Sounds good. Tell your friends not to blow me to pieces when I head on the ship.
> I'll de-activate my disguise.

_KYL300 deactivates its disguise._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:32 PM)_

> `Chomsky`: I guess I'm part of the enemy now... This is strange.

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky coughs, still on the ground._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:32 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett take the grill out yet?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 04:32 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:32 PM)_

_Seth and KYL300 head to the others, hand in hand._

> Hey, guys we agreed on a cease-fire to discuss things.

_Seth raises the KYL unit's hand._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:33 PM)_

> Perhaps. If it makes you feel better, I was practically kidnapped...

_Iris was still not picking Chomsky up._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:33 PM)_

_Emmett gets off the ship with some fuel canisters and the pop-out grill. He sets the package on the ground, sets up the legs, then pulls a switch, causing the grill to "pop-out" into a full-sized consumer grill._

> Kyle, is it?

_Emmett pours some of the fuel into the grill and sticks a couple of burgers on it._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:33 PM)_

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky looks over to the crew cooking, breathing in the smokey meat smell._

> `Chomsky`: Something smells good.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:33 PM)_

> I'm a KYL300 series war droid. You can call me Kyle.

_The KYL unit gives a thumbs up to Emmett._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:33 PM)_

> Indeed. Would you like to go investigate?

_Iris finally pulls Chomsky up._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:34 PM)_

> Nice to meet you, Kyle.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:34 PM)_

_Emmett was focusing on the burgers, but it was clear he was trying to be sincere._

> Hey man. Sorry for nearly tearing you to shreds.
> Just trying to protect my father-thing.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:34 PM)_

> `Chomsky`: Always up for some grub. You guys got any spicy sauce?

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky rubs his hands._

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:34 PM)_

> 's fine. We were practically at war.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 04:34 PM)_

> A robot, huh?

_Sanya scowls at the KYL unit._

> That'sss a ssshame. You don't have any blood.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:35 PM)_

> Hello! We've returned, and it appears that I've recruited Chomsky.

_Iris pats Chomsky's back._

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:35 PM)_

> ... Mhm.

_KYL300 swivels its head to Chomsky._

> Oh, you too, Chomsky?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:35 PM)_

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky shrugs._

> `Chomsky`: Might as well. Couldn't leave my partner in war and crime.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:35 PM)_

> Welcome back, Iris.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:36 PM)_

> So, I've thought about it.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:36 PM)_

_Iris gives a sigh of relief._

> Ah, finally. Back to only one Seth.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:36 PM)_

> Also, Seth.
> It's my grass.

_Emmett gives an unenthused glare at Seth._

> Not yours.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:36 PM)_

> Two elves is plenty for my tastes.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:36 PM)_

> I was talking about my grass.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:36 PM)_

> It seems like it'd be beneficial for everyone if we both joined you.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:36 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes._

> That's space weed.
> Not grass.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:36 PM)_

_Garrick flies about in circles, referencing a holovision show._

> I am crazy weed!

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:37 PM)_

_Seth points finger guns at Garrick excitedly, given that the spectre's reference was for his favorite show._

> My wacky Tabaky!

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:37 PM)_

> We really need to talk about rooms first...

_Emmett groans, hating having to delegate rooms._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:37 PM)_

> `Chomsky`: Uh, good for you.

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky gives a weird thumbs up to Garrick._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:37 PM)_

_Garrick stops flying all over the place and frowns at its behavior._

> Sorry, I don't know what came over me there.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:37 PM)_

> Ah yes. I still do not have a room.

_Seth wiggles his brow suggestively after this statement._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:37 PM)_

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky recalls another spectre being in the crew, but upon looking around, he can't find him anywhere. He shrugs and assumes that in the chaos that he burned alive. It appears that no one else really cares that Asier is gone, so he just goes along with the idea that the shapeshifter had been vanquished._

> `Chomsky`: I'll take the dead black guy's room.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:38 PM)_

> You guys can share with someone else.

_Garrick groans at Chomsky's selection, not wanting to share a room with him._

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:38 PM)_

> `Chomsky`: Or room with Kyle...

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:38 PM)_

> As I understand it, I did, in fact, sleep on Seth's bed last night, and do not have one of my own...

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:39 PM)_

_Emmett peers over the others, counting on his fingers as he lists out the crew._

> So there's me.
> A giant elf.
> A plant person.
> A flame guy?
> A robot.
> A ghost.
> Another ghost, but Disney-themed.
> A llamanian.
> A cyborg.
> A human devil thing.
> A galaxy-esque centaur,
> Some blue blob.
> And Jacob.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:40 PM)_

_Iris's eyes widen after each character being listed, not realizing how many people were in the crew._

> Are we supposed to choose?!

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 04:40 PM)_

> Hmm. We're going to need to sssplit the roomsss up...

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:40 PM)_

> We have five rooms.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:40 PM)_

> We'll just get another ship, no biggy.

_Seth shrugs and flips the burgers for Emmett, who is more focused on room delegation._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:40 PM)_

_Emmett snaps at Seth's suggestion, given that they had just gotten a new ship._

> I'm not spending my hard-earned Ducketts on yet another ship!

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:40 PM)_

> `Chomsky`: I call a room with the war robot.

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky gives a cool smile to KYL300._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:41 PM)_

> I'll pair with anyone, really.

_Garrick shrugs._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:41 PM)_

> I've got a room with Maia.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 04:41 PM)_

> I can stay with anyone. But they ssshould be wary...

_Sanya bites the air as if to be intimidating._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:42 PM)_

> I don't trust Sanya around my marshmallows...

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:42 PM)_

> You wanna stay with me, Sanya?

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 04:42 PM)_

_Sanya's mouth wavers in disgust at the suggestion._

> I'm good, thanksss Ssseth.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:42 PM)_

> Just so you guys know, I can make myself look like a person, if you're more comfortable with that.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:43 PM)_

> I'm fine with anything, man.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:43 PM)_

> I do not have a problem with robots.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:43 PM)_

> `Chomsky`: But then you couldn't use your sick weaponry!

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:43 PM)_

> I can change when I want.
> Do you want to share our room, Iris?

**TheBlade** _(19-Aug-18 04:44 PM)_

_Jim exits the ship, stretching after a long, hangover-infused, nap._

> I would prefer humanoid appearance.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:45 PM)_

> Aren't you with Chomsky?

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:45 PM)_

> I thought you and Chomsky were sharing?

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 04:45 PM)_

_Sanya scowls._

> I'm not ssstaying with Jim.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:45 PM)_

> I wouldn't mind an extra friend though...

_Emmett gives a coy smile._

**TheBlade** _(19-Aug-18 04:45 PM)_

> Why not?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:45 PM)_

> Emmett, you want me to join you?

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:45 PM)_

> There's eleven people...

**TheBlade** _(19-Aug-18 04:45 PM)_

> I'm over the whole "Stabby Stabby" thing.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:46 PM)_

> Wait.

_Emmett happened to forget about Kambras, somehow._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:46 PM)_

> Easy. I'll stay with Jim and Iris.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:46 PM)_

> I think Kambras is comfortable where she is.

_Emmett starts handing out burgers, to the others, each being cooked medium-rare._

**TheBlade** _(19-Aug-18 04:46 PM)_

> How about the droid and the doc with me?

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:46 PM)_

> So my room is filled with ladies.

_Emmett shrugs and smirks._

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:46 PM)_

_KYL300 whispers in Emmett's ear._

> Honestly, I was never comfortable around Chomsky... he's not exactly... 100% sane.

**Brakia** _(19-Aug-18 04:47 PM)_

> Why doesn't Iris stay with me? It would make more sense if the girls stay together.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:47 PM)_

> If you want.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:47 PM)_

> We have to have 3 to a room, remember?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:47 PM)_

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky grimaces._

> `Chomsky`: Your whispering isn't very quiet.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:47 PM)_

_Seth frowns, seemingly no one wanting to room with him._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:47 PM)_

> Or I could share a room with all of the ladies...

_Emmett was fantasizing about sharing a bed with all of the ladies._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:47 PM)_

> I simply do not want to be an inconvenience...

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:47 PM)_

_Garrick slaps Emmett in the back of the head for being horny._

> No, Emmett.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:48 PM)_

> Iris I'd let you bunk with me, but, I'm not sure you'd like the women I'd bring into our room...

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:48 PM)_

> Technically, I have no gender, if that's a factor.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:49 PM)_

_Seth laughs._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:49 PM)_

> I am indifferent towards any quirks my roommates may have. I am also a rather heavy sleeper.
> Just place me where it is most convenient.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:50 PM)_

> I have a feeling Sanya doesn't like me very much.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:50 PM)_

> Well, then Iris, you can bunk with me, if you're comfortable with that.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:50 PM)_

> As I've said, whatever is most convenient to the group.

_Iris shrugs._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:50 PM)_

_Garrick snaps at Iris._

> Do you have any opinion on this at all?

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:50 PM)_

> `Chomsky`: I see how it is. If Kyle doesn't want me then I'll room with the ghost.

_Chomsky groans and points to Garrick._

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:51 PM)_

> No offense.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:51 PM)_

> My opinion is that I don't know any of you well enough to make that judgement.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:52 PM)_

> Nor do I. I'm good with mostly anyone.

**PlasmaPerson** _(19-Aug-18 04:52 PM)_

> `Chomsky`: I'll just pick a random room and hit the hay. See ya.

_`Chomsky`: Chomsky leaves the bumbling idiots._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:52 PM)_

_Iris waves._

> Goodbye Chomsky.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:52 PM)_

> You're certainly not an inconvenience for me. I'm sure it's the same for everyone else.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:52 PM)_

> I wouldn't mind.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:55 PM)_

t!choose Sanya | Iris | Kyle | Jim

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 04:55 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | RPretribution, I pick Iris!

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:55 PM)_

> What about the brig? We could make that into a room.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:55 PM)_

> You're suggesting someone sleeps in the jail?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:55 PM)_

_Seth shrugs._

> We hardly use it anyways.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:55 PM)_

> Could turn the fridge into a room too.

_Emmett giggles at the thought._

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:55 PM)_

_Garrick digs in his pocket and takes out pepper spray. He aims his spray at a victim._

t!choose Sanya | Kyle | Jim

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 04:55 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | RPretribution, I pick Jim!

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:55 PM)_

_Seth doesn't get that Emmett was joking._

> You're right.
> But I use the fridge a lot.

**RPretribution** _(19-Aug-18 04:56 PM)_

_Garrick pepper sprays Jim._

> So I'm with Iris and Jim.

_Garrick takes a large bite into his burger._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:56 PM)_

> My only preference is that I do not sleep in the brig.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:56 PM)_

_Emmett furrows his brow._

> We're not turning the brig into a room. I use it a lot.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:56 PM)_

> Of course.

_Seth nudges Emmett in jest._

> I'm asking your girlfriends some questions.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:57 PM)_

_Emmett remains quiet, flustered._

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:57 PM)_

> Haha! That was funny.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:57 PM)_

_Seth's translator makes a large static sound to the annoyance of everyone listening. It appears that KYL300's shooting managed to break his translator collar._

> To the African american male who has appeared to have entered the household in which I am currently present, I appear to have to tell you that you have chosen to trespass into a very poor choice of available houses, as I am here with a heavy blunt object and could, if i choose to, strike you multiple times upon the head and face, which would undoubtedly cause severe and possibly lethal internal bleeding. With this information being present, I strongly recommend that you leave this home before the situation must be escalated any further.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 04:57 PM)_

_Emmett holds his ears and grunts from the loud noise._

> His translator's broken.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:57 PM)_

_Iris looks to Seth in bizarreness_

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 04:57 PM)_

> Happens a lot...

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 04:57 PM)_

_KYL searches its database for some reference to what Seth just said._

> Is this a joke from Earth's 2018?
> That's REALLY old.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 04:57 PM)_

> Perhaps?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:00 PM)_

> We need to get a new one I guess.

_Seth's translator buzzes loudly._

> COME ON AND SLAM COME ON AND JAM
> UM JAMMER LAMMY

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 05:00 PM)_

> What's wrong with him?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:00 PM)_

> Shit!
> I hate this old translator!

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 05:00 PM)_

_Emmett continues to eat his burger, having added some cheese and lettuce._

> Seth, can I have some of your grass?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:01 PM)_

t!choose Yes | No | Bulldozer | No | Yes | Bulldozer

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 05:01 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | Bagelwrecker, I pick Yes!

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 05:01 PM)_

_Seth hands Emmett some grass begrudgingly._

> Thanks, man.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:02 PM)_

> Fuck you too sleazeball, I'll rip your fucking head off!

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 05:02 PM)_

_The KYL unit is taken aback by Seth's brash response._

> ... Woah.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 05:02 PM)_

_Despite knowing that Seth's translator was broken, Emmett was still surprised by Seth's threat._

> I'm sorry?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:02 PM)_

> Bulldozer.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:03 PM)_

> Your translator is very broken!

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:03 PM)_

> Bulldozer.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:04 PM)_

_Iris recognizes that Seth was speaking in Elvish._

> He actually said yes, just now.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 05:04 PM)_

> I can speak over 20,000 languages.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 05:04 PM)_

_Emmett takes out a digit._

> I can speak one.

_Emmett thinks for a moment, having forgotten about Squoatian, for some reason._

> No, two. I can speak two.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:04 PM)_

> I speak Elvish. A perk of being half-Light elf.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 05:05 PM)_

_Emmett smirks._

> Actually, I know the Llamanian mating phrases and that's it.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:05 PM)_

> REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:05 PM)_

> He says he's sorry for his translator being broken.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 05:05 PM)_

> Tell him "reeee" back.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:06 PM)_

> Dabma Fragaas laonmage!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:06 PM)_

> Alright.

_Iris "rees" in Elvish to Seth._

> He... is very strange.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 05:07 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett change his translator to crazy speech to communicate with Seth?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 05:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Zander.

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 05:08 PM)_

_Emmett, bored, switches his translator to fuck with the others._

> I am going to woo wacka too for the big big neenee.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:08 PM)_

> I can no longer communicate with Emmett. Lovely.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:08 PM)_

_Seth somehow understands Emmett._

> Nakka nakka snu snu!

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 05:08 PM)_

> Even I don't know what the hell they're saying...

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 05:08 PM)_

> Big big wan a us fweg fweg.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:08 PM)_

> Kakakaka!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:08 PM)_

> Yes, I can only understand half of this conversation, and it sounds...

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 05:09 PM)_

> I am not happy because the FWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAn!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:09 PM)_

> Ridiculous.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:09 PM)_

> Nahgas wagas wanaa snu snu Iris!

_Seth airhumps in Iris's direction._

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 05:09 PM)_

> I'm concerned...

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 05:09 PM)_

> Snu snu?

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:09 PM)_

_Iris looks daggers at Seth._

> WHAT ABOUT A PICKLE?!

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 05:10 PM)_

_KYL continues to look into its database._

> Death by snu-snu.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:10 PM)_

> Snu snu gaada wadda!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:10 PM)_

> I should give up now...

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 05:10 PM)_

_Emmett points at Iris and Seth._

> Snu snu you and he!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:10 PM)_

> What is even happening anymore?

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:11 PM)_

_Seth nods erratically._

> UH HUH! UH HUH!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:11 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris decide to drag the two babbling weirdos into the ship before they hurt themselves?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 05:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:11 PM)_

_Iris drags Seth by his collar back to the ship. She waves an arm towards the ship, partially irritated._

> Come on. Let's go.

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 05:12 PM)_

> Good idea.

_KYL300 helps Emmett up from where he was sitting._

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 05:12 PM)_

> Fwinga blinga I wanna Kia in a seeya!

_Emmett smiles and switches his translator back to GU Binary._

> That sounded horrendous...

_Emmett grabs the food and packs up the grill, meeting the others on the ship._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:12 PM)_

> Gave fakka wark tranzolortor!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:12 PM)_

> Let's get back in the ship already...!

_Iris is having trouble dragging Seth onto the ship._

**ProfessorTree** _(19-Aug-18 05:13 PM)_

> I heard something about pickles, Iris, translation, and sex...

**Zander** _(19-Aug-18 05:13 PM)_

> Snu snu means "you you" in ancient Squoatianese.

_Emmett winks at Iris, clearly trying to cover up the fact that they were talking about her inappropriately._

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:13 PM)_

_Seth speaks in Elvish, meaning only Iris can understand him._

> How about I get a new translator, I think I left a spare one inside my backpack?

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:14 PM)_

> Yes, please do that.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:14 PM)_

_Seth attempts to take off his translator but manages to pinch his neck, causing him to howl in pain._

> BULLDOZER!

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:15 PM)_

_Iris continues to speak in Elvish._

> Alright, in Elvish this time. I said yes, get your translator.

**Bagelwrecker** _(19-Aug-18 05:15 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth replace his translator?

**Tatsumaki** _(19-Aug-18 05:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(19-Aug-18 05:16 PM)_

_Iris facepalms._

> Heck.
