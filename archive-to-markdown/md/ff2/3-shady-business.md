@Magic8Ball Does Serpile wake up?

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:13 PM)_

_Serpile wakes up in the ship's bathroom._

> Ugh. Where am I?

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:14 PM)_

> Oh yeah, the shower.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:15 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is Asier near the landing site for the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Brakia says yes, PlasmaPerson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:15 PM)_

> So Emmett how are you feeling?

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:16 PM)_

@Magic8Ball While Seth asks this, is Emmett currently stuffing his head into the toilet bowl?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | N0, Zander.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:16 PM)_

> Terrible.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:16 PM)_

_Seth eyeballs Emmett._

> Mmm

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:17 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth go outside looking for adventure?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:17 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:17 PM)_

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:17 PM)_

_Emmett grimaces at Seth._

> And screw you too.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:17 PM)_

> Ask Math for help.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:18 PM)_

> Strange ship. Space pirates?

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:19 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Serpile check outside?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:19 PM)_

> Wait a minute, who's that?
> Hey, you!

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:19 PM)_

> Squoat be with me.
> Serpile, what are you yelling at?

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:20 PM)_

> Some stalker.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:20 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Asier ignore the weird dragon dude (Serpile)?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nay, PlasmaPerson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:20 PM)_

> Time to go look for some women.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:21 PM)_

> Who are you? State your business!

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:21 PM)_

> Adventure and sex is our business.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:21 PM)_

> Get me some medications, Seth.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:21 PM)_

> Will do.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:21 PM)_

> I could ask you the same thing.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:21 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett get up and trudge over to the commotion?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, Zander.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:22 PM)_

> Oh, hey black guy.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:22 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth go looking for sex, medicine, and adventure?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Bagelwrecker.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:22 PM)_

> I work for an elite team of space police. For your sake, I hope youre not up to any _shady_ things.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:23 PM)_

> You and your puns suck.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:23 PM)_

> Quit throwing shade, man!

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:23 PM)_

> What have I done?

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:23 PM)_

> You all suck.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:23 PM)_

> So, what's your business, man?

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:24 PM)_

> I'm here on patrol.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:24 PM)_

> Patrol? For what?

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:25 PM)_

> Strangers like you.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:25 PM)_

> Damn.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:25 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Serpile inspect the black man?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:25 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Bagelwrecker says no, Brakia.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:25 PM)_

> You going to report us or something?

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:26 PM)_

> Depends. What are you doing here?

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:26 PM)_

> Taking a rest.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:26 PM)_

> Looking for some dumb artifact, I guess.
> We're close to being out of fuel too.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:26 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:27 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Asier show these losers to a fuel place?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:27 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, PlasmaPerson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:27 PM)_

> We should be able to get 12k D's

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:27 PM)_

> I may be able to help you. But for a price.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:27 PM)_

> Is this place far off from here?
> And, what's your price?

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:28 PM)_

> Get my whip and cowboy hat!

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:29 PM)_

> I want to know about this artifact. The place isn't too far. A little trek.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:29 PM)_

> We have no information about the artifact except for the location of it.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:29 PM)_

> I think he can't speak properly.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:30 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett start to puke now, all of a sudden?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:30 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Zander.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:30 PM)_

> You don't know what it does?

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:30 PM)_

> We take missions, we don't ask questions.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:30 PM)_

> Oh god, Emmett.
> Let me get a bucket.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:30 PM)_

> Ah, crap.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:30 PM)_

> Oh my god is he alright?

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:31 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth go looking for sex and medicine?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:31 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:31 PM)_

> I'm undergoing the effects of drinking gasoline for a lady.
> So no, I'm not that alright.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:31 PM)_

> Uh maybe don't drink gasoline next time.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:31 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Serpile go get a bucket for Emmett?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:31 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yeah, Brakia.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:32 PM)_

> Thanks, Serp. I think I need to get back to the ship though.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:32 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:36 PM)_

> I'm intrigued by this artifact you speak of. Mind if I join?

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:36 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Back at the ship, does Emmett get into his grass stash?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:36 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | PlasmaPerson says yes, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:38 PM)_

> Alright I have yet to find sex on this planet. Everyone keeps denying me.
> What a prude planet.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:39 PM)_

> Hey, wait!

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:40 PM)_

> What do you want?

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:40 PM)_

> I have combat expertise. I may be needed in a crisis.
> Sure my boss might get mad, but I've always had a knack for adventure.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:41 PM)_

> Mmhmm. Sure.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:41 PM)_

> Need to get this cooking to really prolong the effects.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:41 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth head off looking for a clinic?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:41 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:41 PM)_

> You can join. However...

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:42 PM)_

> Welp, Emmett, you seem to have things under control.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:42 PM)_

> You're our janitor for now.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:42 PM)_

> I'm not smoking it, as you always suggest, Seth.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:42 PM)_

> I'll be looking for that artifact.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:42 PM)_

> ... Fine.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:43 PM)_

> Literally just going to put it in a pot and boil it.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:43 PM)_

> Well then. Welcome aboard.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:43 PM)_

> Just like Squomma.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:43 PM)_

> I literally do not care what you do with it.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:44 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Asier go to the ship to check it out?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:44 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yeah, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:45 PM)_

> I'm leaving to inspect the ship for... Cleanliness errors.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:45 PM)_

> Hey did you recruit the black ghost man?

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:45 PM)_

> I don't think so.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:45 PM)_

> Oh.
> I was going to say if you did than to tune his comms.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:46 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett pour some water in a pot and put some grass in?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Zander.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:46 PM)_

> Hey guys, I'm in your crew now.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:46 PM)_

> Actually, I think I'm frying it.
> Oh, what?

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:46 PM)_

> Sounds good.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 05:46 PM)_

> That fast?

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:47 PM)_

> I'll be looking for said artifact.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:47 PM)_

> Yep here we go. I'm the janitor or something I guess.
> The Argonian set me up.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:48 PM)_

> The cleaning supplies are in the main deck bathroom.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:48 PM)_

> Actually they're in my room.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:48 PM)_

> Just looking around.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:48 PM)_

> I had to clean some blood and cum out of my sheets.
> And walls.
> And floor.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:49 PM)_

> Oh. Well they're in his room then.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:49 PM)_

_Asier heads to Seth's room, mortified._

> Can I skip this room, argonian?

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:49 PM)_

> You can skip my room.
> I'd prefer if you did.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:49 PM)_

> Okay.
> I don't want to mess with...
> Whatever goes on in here...

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:50 PM)_

> The name is Serpile. It would do you well to remember that.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:50 PM)_

> If I'm the janitor, then what roles do you people have?

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:51 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth go looking for the artifact?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:51 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:51 PM)_

> Me? I'm the mechanic.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:51 PM)_

> Goat man and I are the co-captains.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:52 PM)_

> Then what power do you have over my position?

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:52 PM)_

> He nearly has none.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:52 PM)_

> If you don't do what I say, I'm going to stick you in the main engine.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:53 PM)_

_Asier gasps in a joking manner._

> For shame, serpile. For shame.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:53 PM)_

> If you don't lighten up and stop being a space-douche I'll airlock you, Serpile.
> Let the ghost man look around the ship but keep an eye on him.
> Don't need him stealing stuff.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:54 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Would Seth actually airlock Serpile?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:54 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:54 PM)_

> Fine. But i'm watching you, shade.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 05:55 PM)_

> No need to throw "shade".

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:55 PM)_

> Please, call me Asier.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 05:55 PM)_

> Whatever, shade.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 05:56 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Asier sock Serpile in the face?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 05:56 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Brakia says no, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:00 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is Emmett now seen chewing on some blackened strands of grass?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:00 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:01 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth find the location of the temple?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:01 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:02 PM)_

> So, welcome to the ship, black dude.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:02 PM)_

> Please don't call me _black dude_.
> My name is Asier.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:02 PM)_

> I call him shade.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:02 PM)_

> Name's Emmett.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:03 PM)_

> Hey, I found the Temple.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:04 PM)_

> Sorry for puking earlier.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:05 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Serpile punch Asier in the face?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:05 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nay, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:07 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Serpile suddenly jump 6 times and do the whip and nay nay?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | NO, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:08 PM)_

> So, what now? Don't you need fuel?

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:09 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does the lounge of the ship have an odor of fried grass now?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:09 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nay, Zander.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:09 PM)_

> Swag.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:09 PM)_

> That... That doesn't answer my question.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:09 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth enter the temple without those losers?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:09 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yay, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:09 PM)_

> Shade, come with me. We're going to go get fuel.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:10 PM)_

> Will do.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:10 PM)_

> Hey, Seth? Ever wonder what the inside of a temple looks like?

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:10 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do we get to the fueling station quickly?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:10 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nay, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:11 PM)_

> Nope.
> I went to one often as a wee boy.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:11 PM)_

_Emmett gets up, bored._

> Alright, I'm done pretending to be baked. Toss me your coordinates.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:11 PM)_

> Alright sending them over now.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:12 PM)_

> Sheesh, you're closer than I thought.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:12 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:13 PM)_

> You landed pretty close luckily.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:13 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does it take a while for Emmett to get accustomed to the gravity?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Zander.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:13 PM)_

> Hey Serpile?
> Are you tired of walking? Because I'm not.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:13 PM)_

> Screw you, you non-corporeal jerk.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:14 PM)_

> This planet is strangely heavy.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:14 PM)_

> Meh, it feels a little like home.
> Could be a little less heavy though.
> I feel some pressure.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:17 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:18 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:18 PM)_

> Yes.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:19 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do I take out my laser pistol and look around?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Wait to ask this again, Bagelwrecker.

@Magic8Ball Do we find the store yet?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yeah, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:21 PM)_

> Welp. Here we are.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:21 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:21 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Asier know where the fuel is in the store?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nay, PlasmaPerson.

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett take out his laser crossbow?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Zander.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:22 PM)_

> I'm an assassin, not a shopper.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:22 PM)_

> You sure this place isn't dangerous?

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:23 PM)_

> Welp, we're going to be in here for a while.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:23 PM)_

_Seth was thinking about having sex until Emmett appears, which snaps him out of it._

> Nope, let's go.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:24 PM)_

> Let's ask someone!
> Hey! You! Employee!

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:25 PM)_

> Well, I'm not going to sit at the entrance staring at some naked lady I'm daydreaming about.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:25 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do I draw my laser pistol and look around?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:25 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:25 PM)_

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:26 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do they tell us where the ship fuel is?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:26 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:26 PM)_

_After looking around for a while, Seth realizes there's no danger._

> Alright well, lets go do something else.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:27 PM)_

> Oh.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:28 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is the store out of fuel?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:28 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:28 PM)_

> It's kind-of hard for me to understand a joke at the moment. Everything's kinda hazy.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:28 PM)_

> Oh dang. No fuel.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:29 PM)_

> OH FOR FUCK'S SAKES!

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:29 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is their fuel obviously seen stuck inside the buttcracks of each of the fat ladies zooming around the market?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Zander.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:29 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is their fuel obviously seen stuck inside the buttcracks of each of the fat men zooming around the market?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:29 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:30 PM)_

> Oh no. Look at the fat men!

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:30 PM)_

> Dude, let's go already.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:31 PM)_

_Seth stares into the cleavage of a statue mindlessly._

> I'm waiting for you to enter.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:31 PM)_

_Emmett is staring into a dark hallway on the other side of the room the two are in._

> I'm already in here though!

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:31 PM)_

> Well you go first, then.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:32 PM)_

> Fine.

_Emmett slowly peeks into the hall, a bit paranoid of what could be inside._

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:32 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does asier use his stealth to steal the fuel out of the fat men's butts?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:32 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:32 PM)_

> I'm glad I don't have skin because that could have been much worse. At least me got the fuel!

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:33 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do the fat men begin to notice the lack of fuel canisters in their rears and start to get angry?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:33 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, Zander.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:33 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do Asier and Serpile escape the store?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:35 PM)_

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:37 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett end up stopping at a cliche pit with a single vine protruding from the ceiling?

ðŸŽ± | YES, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:37 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does the fat man pick up Serpile and stick him in his butthole?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:37 PM)_

_Seth enters the room after Emmett, staring into the spike pit._

> Looks like fun.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:37 PM)_

> NOOOO! SERPILE!

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:38 PM)_

> This is vaguely familiar.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:38 PM)_

> `Fat Man`: MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:39 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do I shoot and kill the fat man?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:39 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Brakia.

_Emmett leaps to the vine, attempting to grab it._

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett successfully traverse the pit?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:39 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yeah, Zander.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:39 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do Seth just jump over the pit?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:40 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Bagelwrecker.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:40 PM)_

> We'll perform surgery later!

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:40 PM)_

> Alright, I'll be there in a second. Need to make sure I can bound this.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:40 PM)_

> Suit yourself.

_Emmett heads into the next room haphazardly, figuring that was the worst to come._

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:41 PM)_

> I hate you, Asier!

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:42 PM)_

> Hey Seth? There's a room full of heads in here.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:42 PM)_

> Oh, fun!

_Seth leans into the pit and tries to measure the distance._

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:42 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Serpile escape the fat man's butt?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:42 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 14! Yes, Brakia.

_Emmett pinches his nose._

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:42 PM)_

> Wanna play intergalactic soccer with them?

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:43 PM)_

_Serpile squeezes his way out of the fat man's rear and exhales in relief._

> THANK GOD!

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:44 PM)_

> I don't think these heads have hovers on them.
> I think we have to step on them to continue.

_Seth, seemingly stalling, rubs his fingers with some dust from the temple floor._

> Sounds fun.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:45 PM)_

> Well, at least we don't have to deal with him anymore.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:46 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do Seth swing over to Emmett?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase no, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:46 PM)_

> I will be over there soon!

_Seth attempts to swing on the vine over but manages to break the vine, causing him to fall into the spike pit. Luckily, the spikes are fairly dull._

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:46 PM)_

_Emmett continues to stare at the rotting head platforms._

> Did I just hear you fall?

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:46 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do Asier and Serpile get to the ship quickly?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:46 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett check into the pit anyways?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:49 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Zander.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:50 PM)_

> Here. You know where the fuel goes.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:50 PM)_

> Seth, I can hear you echoing louder than usual.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:50 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth climb out of the pit and toward Emmett?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:50 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Maybe, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:50 PM)_

> Are you sure you didn't fall?

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:50 PM)_

_Serpile and Asier exit the ship in a random direction._

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:52 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Did Seth send his coordinates to the others?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Bagelwrecker says no, Zander.

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Maybe, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:53 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do Serpile and Asier magically stumble across the temple?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:53 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 9! No, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:54 PM)_

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:54 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 2! No, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:55 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth need Emmett's help to get out of the pit?

_Emmett looks back at the pit, assuming that Seth fell into the pit._

> I'm coming back for you then.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:56 PM)_

_Seth jumps up and grabs the ledge of the pit._

> No you aren't.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:56 PM)_

_Emmett, having gone back to the pit, peers over Seth._

> I'm right here.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:57 PM)_

> Hey Rawley where's the temple?

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:57 PM)_

> `Rawley`: Mrow?

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:57 PM)_

> Stupid cat.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 06:57 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do the two finally find the temple?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:57 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Bagelwrecker says no, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 06:58 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Asier shapeshift to have cat ears so he can understand Rawley, who tells them where the temple is?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:58 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:59 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett put his arm down into the pit for Seth?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:59 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Wait to ask this again, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:59 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth walk through a tunnel in the pit?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 06:59 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 06:59 PM)_

_Seth notices a tunnel in the pit and heads through it._

> Bye.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 06:59 PM)_

_Emmett sighs._

> Freaking liar.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:00 PM)_

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 07:00 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Serpile find the Temple and tell Asier about it?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:00 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Brakia.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:01 PM)_

> I'm calling the others if you don't get up here.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:01 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does fate finally smile upon the two and they find the temple and the team?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:01 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, PlasmaPerson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:01 PM)_

> I might of found an exit give me a sex-ond.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:01 PM)_

_Emmett folds his arms, tapping his backhoof impatiently._

> Ugh, fine.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:02 PM)_

> Serpile we found it! Now let's get in there and join the action!

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:02 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett carefully traverse the head pikes and continue onwards?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Zander.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:02 PM)_

_Emmett, impatient, decides to jump across the head platforms. Unfortunately, he slips on one, causing his hoof to be stabbed by a sharp pike._

> Ah! My hoof!

_Emmett manages to make it across and holds his now bleeding hoof._

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:03 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth come across a large group of women and uses his charisma to make them have sex with him?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:03 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Wait to ask this again, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(24-Jun-18 07:04 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Serpile go to sleep in the ship restroom now?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:06 PM)_

> Okay, well bye, I guess.

@Magic8Ball Does Asier walk past the scene and find Emmett?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:09 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:10 PM)_

_Asier just flies over all of the obstacles Emmett and Seth took forever to traverse._

> Emmett!

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:11 PM)_

_Emmett jumped, startled by Asier's sudden appearance._

> My foot is hurting badly.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:11 PM)_

> Did you step on the spikes?

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:12 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is there something actually interesting in the next room?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | N0, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:12 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Are the virgins guarding the ancient artifact?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 1! No, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:13 PM)_

_Emmett glares at Asier and mutters sarcastically._

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:14 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Did Asier remember to grab a med kit from the ship just in case?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 11! Yes, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:14 PM)_

_Asier takes out a canister without reading it._

> Take this.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:15 PM)_

> Gee, anti-itch cream.
> Great for Spanish Flu, I guess.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:15 PM)_

> You know Emmett, you should of fallen down this pit.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:15 PM)_

> Uh...

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:15 PM)_

> Hey Seth, I know you found some women or something.
> But guess what?
> I bet those women don't even exist.

@Magic8Ball Do the women exist, for Seth's sake?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:16 PM)_

> Doesn't matter had sex with holograms
> Magical sex is better than no sex

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:17 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:18 PM)_

_After a bit of silence, Seth continues._

> Anyways, I'm pushing forward.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:18 PM)_

> I'm only hearing one side of this conversation and its so weird.

_Asier helps bandage up Emmett's hoof._

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:18 PM)_

> Thanks for the bandages, I guess.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:18 PM)_

> Yeah, for your hoof.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:18 PM)_

> Also, Seth is a sex-crazed freak. He just pulverized a whole bunch of holograms.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:19 PM)_

> Oh!

@Magic8Ball Does Seth find the artifact in the next room?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Bagelwrecker.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:20 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is the artifact a magic hotdog covered in old mayonnaise?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:21 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do Asier and Emmett stumble into the same room?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, Zander.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:21 PM)_

_The two meet up with Seth._

> Oh, hey.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:21 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth eat the hotdog?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, Bagelwrecker.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:21 PM)_

> Oh, hey, a hotdog.
> Probably don't eat it, you'll get sick again.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:21 PM)_

> This was a tasty hotdog!

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:21 PM)_

> Oh no!

@Magic8Ball Is there another artifact in the temple?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does a little worm climb into Seth's butt and take the hotdog out of him, putting it back onto the pedestal?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:24 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth puke the hotdog up into the lava surrounding the pedestal, thus obliterating it?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Bagelwrecker.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:25 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does the group head for the exit?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:26 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Bagelwrecker says yes, PlasmaPerson.

@Magic8Ball Does Seth pee out the hotdog as a liquid into a jar?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:36 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:36 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:37 PM)_

_Asier takes a good look at the jar, noticing remnants of the hotdog artifact within it._

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:37 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Are the female statues angry now the Seth liquified the hotdog?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:37 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett start flying and make the ceiling say "Goo goo ga ga"?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:39 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:39 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does the group make it safely back to the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:39 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:40 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:40 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:40 PM)_

> Go away you creeps!

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:40 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do half of the stone women start tugging at Seth's arm?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 07:45 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase no.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:46 PM)_

_Seth manages to de-marblize only his face and winks at a statue._

> So do you want a drink or do you want some gravel?

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:47 PM)_

> I think they want your hotdog juice.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:47 PM)_

> Of course they do!

_Seth winks at you, the reader._

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:47 PM)_

> Not like that, man.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:47 PM)_

> What do you mean? That's my piss!

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:48 PM)_

> Duh.

_Emmett puts a hoof to his face in frustration._

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:48 PM)_

> It's like hotdog water.
> You know the stuff left after you boil a hotdog?

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 07:49 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth convince the statues to have sex with him?

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 07:55 PM)_

_Emmett pushes Seth out of the way and sits in the pilot's seat._

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 07:57 PM)_

t!choose Antarctica | Asia | North America | Africa | Europe | South America | Australia

**Tatsumaki** _(24-Jun-18 07:57 PM)_
