**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:01 PM)_

`Serpile`: @Magic8Ball Does Serpile wake up?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:01 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:02 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Asier wake up?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Zander says yes, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:02 PM)_

_Asier springs up from his bed with vibrant energy._

> Ha ha! the soldier wakes first!

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:03 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is Emmett feeling better?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:03 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:03 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does the crew wake up for 2 seconds and back to sleep for 2 seconds and then repeat this forever?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:03 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yeah, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:04 PM)_

`Serpile`: @Magic8Ball Does the crew stop this endless cycle?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:05 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Asier wake up the others?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:05 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:05 PM)_

> Alright! Everybody up!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:05 PM)_

> Where is my escort?

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:05 PM)_

_`Serpile`: Serpile groans._

> `Serpile`: Five more minutes...

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:05 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Asier's waking up of the everyone suddenly make Emmett feel better?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:05 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Zander.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:06 PM)_

> Feeling better yet, Emmett?

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:06 PM)_

_Although feeling better, Emmett was tad grumpy from being woken up._

> Probably not...

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:07 PM)_

> You've been sick for like, two equinoxes.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:07 PM)_

_`Serpile`: Serpile is hallucinating from his long rest._

> `Serpile`: Um, question. Why is there a hot dog tied to my foot?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:08 PM)_

> There's not???

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:08 PM)_

> `Serpile`: Oh.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:08 PM)_

> Gimme my jar back!

_Seth storms into Serpile's sleeping quarters and eyeballs the jar full of hot dog bits and urine._

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:08 PM)_

> Gasoline kinda sticks, I guess.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:08 PM)_

> I pee'd it out it's mine!

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:08 PM)_

> I think I need to piss though, if that makes you feel better.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:09 PM)_

> Why would that make me feel better

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:09 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do I shoot Matthias in the foot?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:09 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Wait to ask this again, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:09 PM)_

> `Serpile`: Please take it back.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:09 PM)_

> I dunno'.

_Emmett heads to the restroom, speaking into his comms._

> Hey Serpile? How's the ship looking?

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:10 PM)_

> `Serpile`: It looks alright...

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:10 PM)_

> Did you shine the thrusters?

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:11 PM)_

_`Serpile`: Serpile doesn't remember shining the thrusters, but it sounded like something he would do._

> `Serpile`: I think so.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:11 PM)_

> I always need my thrusters shined.
> I like thrusting and so does the ship!

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:11 PM)_

`Serpile`: @Magic8Ball Does Serpile give the jar back?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | PlasmaPerson says yes, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:11 PM)_

> Thank you.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:12 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does the crew head outside the ship to look for more adventure?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:13 PM)_

> I'm bored.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:13 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett first take a long piss, thus making him now feel in tip top shape?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nay, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:14 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett pee into the jar making him better, but also causing the jar to smash on Matthias, and because the pee in the jar is connected to Serpile via the plot, Serpile goes and licks it up?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:15 PM)_

_Seth blocks the restroom hatch before Emmett has a chance to relieve himself._

Piss in the jar. It'll make you feel better.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:15 PM)_

_Emmett shrugs and decides to piss in the jar without question. He wasn't in the mood to argue today._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:15 PM)_

_Seth takes the jar once Emmett is done and throws it into Matthia's bed, causing it to smash atop of him while he slept._

> All better little buddy?

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:15 PM)_

_Emmett belches._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:15 PM)_

> Okay.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:15 PM)_

> Hey, that's the artifact! What are you doing!

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:15 PM)_

_`Serpile`: Serpile mistakes the smell of the hot dog piss water for coffee somehow and heads into Matthias's room. He tries a taste of the piss, ignoring the glass shards about him._

`Serpile`: @Magic8Ball Does Serpile die from the piss water being in his system, having been made to drink it due to universal bullshit?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:16 PM)_

_Seth follows Serpile and notices him twitch and collapse. He tries his pulse for a couple of seconds._

> Our mechanic is dead.

_Seth prods Matthias sharply._

> Do something, bird man.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:16 PM)_

> Pee on him or some shit!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:17 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Serpile come back to life, making Seth question life choices, therefore he becomes a better and not inappropriate character?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:17 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, PlasmaPerson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:18 PM)_

_Seth sighs and leaves the room. He's unfazed from the sudden crew death due to his longevity._

> Alright black ghost man, here's a job for you, clean up this dead body and we'll promote you to mechanic.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:19 PM)_

_Emmett frowns, having been aware of Serpile's terminal condition to mistake urine for coffee._

> Man, I liked Serpile.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:19 PM)_

> But I have no mechanical expertise!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:19 PM)_

> Meh.

_Seth puts a finger to his chin in thought._

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:19 PM)_

> Too bad he had Space Urinitus...

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:19 PM)_

> That's fine, then we'll promote you to crew member.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:19 PM)_

> But...
> Am I not already?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:20 PM)_

> No you're a janitor.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:20 PM)_

> Made so by a dead man!

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:20 PM)_

_Emmett audibly groans and loudly speaks into his watch comms._

> You're a crew member, discussion ended.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:20 PM)_

> Crew members go on missions, janitors clean.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:20 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes._

> Seth, go find a hooker or something.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:20 PM)_

> There's a big difference, Emmett.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:20 PM)_

_Asier was understandably flustered._

> Hey, I got the fuel!
> It was a harrowing mission!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:20 PM)_

> It's illegal to hire a hooker in this part of the GU.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:21 PM)_

> Asier, let's go for a walk.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:21 PM)_

_Asier purses his lips and lowers his brow in annoyance before meeting up with Emmett._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:21 PM)_

> Pick some grass while you're at it, I'm running out of my stash.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:22 PM)_

_Emmett sighs._

> You've been taking my grass?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:22 PM)_

> I grow some of my own.
> But my crops died.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:22 PM)_

_Asier speaks in a mocking tone._

> Use a revive pill.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:22 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett start dragging Asier in a random direction?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | N0, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:22 PM)_

> The blood from that lady that bathed in acid fucked it up.

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett start dragging Asier in a random direction?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yeah, Bagelwrecker.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:23 PM)_

> Okay I guess we're going now.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:24 PM)_

> Let me tell you something.

_Emmett pulls Asier in closer, speaking softly as they walked across the grasslands outside the ship._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:24 PM)_

> Yeah?

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:24 PM)_

> Our bounty hunting crew is a bit screwed up.
> Half of us have no morals whatsoever.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:25 PM)_

_Asier rolls his eyes._

> I could have guessed that.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:25 PM)_

> The other half try to make those without morals not get into trouble.
> It's really stupid.
> But it keeps us together.
> With you being a crew member now, you can do whatever you want.
> We're completely neutral in regards to the law.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:26 PM)_

> I suppose. And protecting others is in my job description, or at least, what I signed up for.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:28 PM)_

> Is it?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:28 PM)_

> Well yeah. I'm a law enforcer, as well as a soldier. Soldiers protect.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:29 PM)_

> Ah.

_Emmett inhales deeply._

> I'm here to stick with my co-captain.
> He saved my life, you see.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:30 PM)_

> Oh yeah?

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:31 PM)_

> It was just before the Purgation of Vortox.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:32 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett talk about his past for an hour or more

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:32 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Zander says possibly, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:32 PM)_

> Life on Vortox-56 was okay.
> At least, I wouldn't really know as for adult life.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:35 PM)_

> Hey, the riots were pretty okay too.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:35 PM)_

> I was a kid. If you were there, you would have seen me as a little nerd with a few friends here and there.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:36 PM)_

> Still little nerd

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:36 PM)_

> I didn't grow up on earth, I know that much, but I don't remember much before I was moved to earth. It was a very long time ago.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:37 PM)_

> Then suddenly, an invasion occurred.
> The Llamanians started to turn on our people.
> Villages were burnt, people were killed.
> I was under the protection of my family.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:38 PM)_

> And me, don't forget.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:39 PM)_

> Actually, I didn't know what the hell was going on.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:39 PM)_

> Don't forget. I was hired as a merc, remember?

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:39 PM)_

> I was just sitting in my room.
> I heard gunshots and eventually an explosion nearby.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:40 PM)_

> Those weren't me but those fatasses from Vector Q-42.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:40 PM)_

> In my living area, there was nothing left of my family.
> I mean, I didn't see my squrother.

> But Seth said my squother was impaled and my squather was in chunks.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:42 PM)_

> Oh no!
> How horrible!

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:42 PM)_

> Outside, there was more than just Squoso-Llamano chaos occurring.
> Space pirates, mercenaries, and worst of all, hundreds of Squanchy were causing a ruckus all there.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:43 PM)_

> What are the squanch?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:44 PM)_

> That's about the time I came around.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:44 PM)_

> Fluffy creatures that look very similar to us, though more of a mix of canine and feline.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:45 PM)_

> Terrible little creatures they are.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:45 PM)_

> I was underneath fiery rubble whenever Seth came along.

@Magic8Ball At the end of this tale, does Bail appear?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:45 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase no, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:45 PM)_

> He was just laying there all defeated.
> He was covered in soot, blood, and all that.
> I came around, picked the kid up, and brought him with me.
> I fought through hell and shitfire to bring him back to my ship.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:48 PM)_

> He also brought a whole bunch of ladies too.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:48 PM)_

> I almost got caught for smuggling them.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:48 PM)_

> Who ended up being airlocked...

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:48 PM)_

> You had a lot of grass in your pockets by the way...
> I smoked it all.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:49 PM)_

> Anyways, that's how I met Seth.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:49 PM)_

> Yep.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:50 PM)_

> He raised me from a teen, teaching me how to pilot, shoot, and communicate.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 02:50 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth go to sleep?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:50 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:50 PM)_

> And I saved him from severe alcohol poisoning and likely death.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:50 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do we see Bail now?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:50 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Wait to ask this again, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:51 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do we see Bail now?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:51 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Zander.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:51 PM)_

> Oh hey. A glowing man.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:51 PM)_

> Look at that bright light!

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:51 PM)_

_Bail tips his hat, cowboy-style._

> That's racist.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:51 PM)_

_Emmett raises an eyebrow in confusion._

> Since when is glowing a race?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:51 PM)_

> It speaks!

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:52 PM)_

_Bail was enraged from Asier's response._

> "It speaks"?!

@Magic8Ball Does Bail kick Asier in the face?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nay, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:53 PM)_

> State your business, mister out here in the middle of nowhere.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:53 PM)_

> I heard someone was talking shit.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:54 PM)_

> We're kind-of next to a police station.
> I think.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:54 PM)_

> Oh hey, that's where my boss works!
> Best not draw attention.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:54 PM)_

> So, what is a motley crew of you two doing here?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:54 PM)_

_Asier smiles, daydreaming about his boss._

> He gets grumpy in the morning...

_Asier shakes his head, snapping out of it._

> We're just talking.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:55 PM)_

> Telling him of my elvish upbringing. You?

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:55 PM)_

> Inspecting the newcomers.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:55 PM)_

> Oh hey, I used to do that!
> But uh...
> I quit.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:56 PM)_

> So, uh...

_Emmett notices a label on Bail's vest._

> Bail, are you good at fixing things?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:57 PM)_

_Asier giggles to himself._

> Starman, more like ocean man.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 02:57 PM)_

> Maybe. How do you know my name?

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 02:57 PM)_

> There's a label on your left pectoral.
> Just says "Bail Bail Man" as if it is making fun of you.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 02:58 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does bail T-Pose?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 02:58 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:02 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is Garrick behind Bail?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:03 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is Garrick eating bail's fries?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:03 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 03:04 PM)_

> Those jerks.

_Bail looks at his nametag and dusts it off, annoyed._

> They changed it again.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:05 PM)_

> So your name is actually Bail?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:05 PM)_

> That's kinda funny though, that name tag.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:05 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is Garrick in the room?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:05 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase no, RPretribution.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 03:05 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Bail join the motley crew on their adventure yet?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:05 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nay, Brakia.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:05 PM)_

> Huh.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:06 PM)_

> Bail, are you tired of being made fun of?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:06 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Garrick notice the trio talking NOW????

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Wait to ask this again, PlasmaPerson.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 03:06 PM)_

> Yes.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:07 PM)_

> Then join us, and together we can get revenge on the petty name-calling.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:08 PM)_

_Asier draws his swords at the thought of the police station._

> I never really liked that job too much.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:08 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett take out his laser crossbow?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:08 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase no, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:08 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth wake up and feel the urge for murder?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:08 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 13! Yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:09 PM)_

> Hey Emmett we should go murder some people.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:09 PM)_

_Emmett moves his comms watch to his snout and whispers._

> I'm getting us another mechanic right now.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 03:10 PM)_

t!choose 3 | 5 | 7 | 29

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Jun-18 03:10 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | Brakia64, I pick 7!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:10 PM)_

> Fine.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 03:10 PM)_

> Welp, let's go shoot up a police station.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:10 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Garrick go inside the police station?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:10 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, RPretribution.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:10 PM)_

_Emmett is taken aback by this response, scoffing._

> What the hell?

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:10 PM)_

_Garrick overhears the trio before entering the police station._

> Sounds fun.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:11 PM)_

_Emmett stares at Asier and Bail wide-eyed._

> I was just talking about pranking them.
> Not killing them!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:11 PM)_

> I prefer killing them.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:11 PM)_

> Oh.

_Asier retracts his swords._

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:11 PM)_

_Garrick, instead of entering the police station, decides to head to the group._

> Either's fine with me.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 03:12 PM)_

> Fine.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:12 PM)_

> Ghost man! Where did you come from?

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:12 PM)_

> My house.
> Obviously.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:12 PM)_

> ... Touche.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:12 PM)_

t!choose Emmett knows Garrick | Seth knows Garrick | Garrick knows Garrick | Bail knows Garrick | Jim Johnson knows Garrick | Jacob knows Garrick | Matthias knows Garrick

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:14 PM)_

> No.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 03:14 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Bail join the crew yet?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | PlasmaPerson says yes, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:14 PM)_

_Asier looks at Garrick._

> Wanna help us raid a police station?

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:15 PM)_

> But why?

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:15 PM)_

> Sure.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:15 PM)_

> Better than sitting around doing nothing! It's like you said, we're neutral.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:15 PM)_

_Garrick takes out a toothpick from his pocket and pretends to clean his teeth._

> What could go wrong?

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:16 PM)_

> Probably going into space prison, I dunno.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 03:16 PM)_

_Bail whips his head back._

> Everything.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:16 PM)_

> You can't handcuff a ghost. We have no arms.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:17 PM)_

> They have spectral cuffs.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:17 PM)_

_Garrick folds his hands._

> Darn.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:17 PM)_

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:18 PM)_

_Emmett sighs and takes a look at his laser crossbow._

> Peer pressure!

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:18 PM)_

> Alright.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 03:18 PM)_

_Bail decides to lead the charge into the station and heads forward._

> Let's go.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:19 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett go with the others to murder police for no reason?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Bagelwrecker says no, but he convinces them to not do that, Zander.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:20 PM)_

> Guys, do we seriously want to do this?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:20 PM)_

> Step one, lower in and inspect surroundings...

_Asier starts to climb onto the roof behind Bail._

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:20 PM)_

> Uh...
> Yes.

_Garrick shrugs somehow._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:20 PM)_

> Yes.

_Asier gets atop of the roof._

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:20 PM)_

> Why?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:21 PM)_

> We could get good stuff.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:21 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth rush into the police station screaming and shooting?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Zander says yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:21 PM)_

> I have a pretty clean record.
> I think.

_Emmett mutters to himself._

> I hope.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:21 PM)_

> You think?

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:21 PM)_

_Garrick laughs._

> I don't.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:22 PM)_

_Seth busts down the back door to the police station with dual plasma rifles._

> AYY AY AY!
> GIVE ME YOUR LITTLE ONES!

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:22 PM)_

> Seth might have gotten me to do some drunk stuff...

_The moment Seth rushes past him, Emmett runs off to a safe distance from the police station._

> WHAT THE FUCK, SETH?!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:22 PM)_

> What are you doing? This is a stealth mission!

> Make a plan..
> Expect the plan to go wrong!
> Throw away the plan!

_Bail kicks down the roof entrance and Asier follows behind him._

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:24 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Garrick go with Asier's plan?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, RPretribution.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:24 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Bail snap one of his ex-coworkers necks, simply by just walking in through the roof entrance?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, Zander.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:24 PM)_

> PUT YOUR STICKS IN THE AIR! THIS IS A HAND-UP!

_Garrick digs into his pockets and takes out a holovision remote, which he throws at an officer, and then he grabs a baton._

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:24 PM)_

> `Bail`: Justice!

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:24 PM)_

> DANG IT!

_Garrick holds his head._

> Let's start over...

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:25 PM)_

> DAME TO COSITA!

_Seth starts to shoot in the general direction of the officers._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:25 PM)_

_Asier draws his magic whip._

@Magic8Ball Does Asier drop in from the roof with grace and ease?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:25 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase no, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:26 PM)_

> OW!

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:26 PM)_

_Jim looks around a corner and ducks beneath some stray shots from Seth._

> The hell is going on here?

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:26 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett run back to the ship to get it over there as an escape vehicle?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:26 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Zander.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:26 PM)_

> Great stealth mission, guys.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:26 PM)_

> Idiots...

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:26 PM)_

> Hey, not my fault!

_Seth continues to shoot at the officers._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:26 PM)_

> Quick! Raid the cabinets!

_Asier heads to the armory._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:27 PM)_

> I couldn't find a woman to have sex with on this planet!

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:27 PM)_

> Let's get their guns!

_Garrick follows Asier and helps grab some weapons._

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:27 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Jim have a shotgun under his desk?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:27 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, TheBlade.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:27 PM)_

> Seth, remind me why you need women?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:27 PM)_

> Addiction!

_Seth laughs maniacally._

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:28 PM)_

_Jim heads to the armory and points his shotgun at Asier._

> Now hold on just a minute, let's just put the guns down...

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:28 PM)_

> Don't worry, my penis is included in this plan Emmett!

_Seth immediately gets an erection, ripping his trousers._

> SHOW ME THE WOMEN!!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:28 PM)_

> What gun? All I need is my blades!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:28 PM)_

> I WANT WOMEN TO FUCK!!

_Seth is now just shooting in random directions._

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:28 PM)_

> I don't have any guns.
> Well, I might...

_Garrick points a finger gun at Jim._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:29 PM)_

> Garrick, what Are you hiding?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:29 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth take a woman out of a cell and run back to the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | N0, Bagelwrecker.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:29 PM)_

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:32 PM)_

_Jim is surprised from his autotargetting failing, and decides to mess with his biotic eye for a couple seconds._

> Well shit.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:32 PM)_

> Oh my god, you killed that guy!

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:32 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes and turns away from the station._

> I'm going back to the ship, guys.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:32 PM)_

> ... Oh, wow.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:32 PM)_

_Seth walks into the armory._

> Join us!
> Or perish!

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:33 PM)_

_Emmett mutters._

> Or just leave you guys.

_Garrick takes out a slug pistol._

> Oh, nice. I didn't know I had a gun in here.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:33 PM)_

> Stay right where you are, I'll shoot, I swear it I will!

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:34 PM)_

> Alright.

_Garrick aims at Jim._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:34 PM)_

> Do it loser!

_Seth air humps, hitting his penis on a metal railing._

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:34 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett just go back to the ship now?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:34 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Maybe, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:34 PM)_

> GIVE ME SEX OR DIE!!!

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:34 PM)_

_Emmett talks to himself._

> Yeah, I'm going away from this situation.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:34 PM)_

> Huh.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:34 PM)_

_Asier takes out his sword._

> I'm a shape shifter, those bullets will miss me.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:35 PM)_

> Try buckshot.

_Jim flicks a lever on his shotgun, causing the barrel to spin menacingly._

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:35 PM)_

> I'm a ghost. Bullets don't really... work.
> But I mean, do what you want.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:35 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Bail start sniping his co-workers from literally an inch away?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:35 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:36 PM)_

> Then how are you supposed to hit me?

_Jim hears Bail's "sniping" and freaks out a bit, however he maintains his aim thanks to his implants._

> Oh Jesus Christ!`

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:36 PM)_

> I poop on poop!

_Seth heads to the cells and bangs his penis on every cell._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:37 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Asier enter combat with the robot?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, PlasmaPerson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:37 PM)_

_Seth stops at a cell with a man cowering in the corner._

> AND I SHALL POOP ON YOU!

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:37 PM)_

> What the hell are you doing, elf guy?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:37 PM)_

_Seth wiggles his hips._

> CAUSE YOU POOP!

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:37 PM)_

_Emmett is sitting in the ship's kitchen, having grabbed a cup of GUice and some chips._

> I'm assuming you guys got it covered? Don't need an escape route?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:37 PM)_

> We do.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:37 PM)_

_Asier sighs and puts his swords away._

> Fine. We'll show a little mercy, in exchange for your cash.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:37 PM)_

_Garrick overheard Asier's comms watch and spoke aloud, assuming he was being spoken to directly._

> We do.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:37 PM)_

> We need an escape route!

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:38 PM)_

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:38 PM)_

_Alarmed by Bail's continuous murder in the other room, Jim surrenders and flicks the lever on his shotgun, putting it down._

> Okay, okay, I'm putting the gun down, just don't shoot anyone else, and it will all be fine...

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:38 PM)_

_Seth leaves the poor prisoner alone and joins the others with a pair of handcuffs grabbed from the cell room._

> Spectral cuff him!

@Magic8Ball Does Seth grab a harem of women and run away to the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:38 PM)_

> I don't know, probably not a lot.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:40 PM)_

_Jim scoffs._

> See how far that will get ya'.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:40 PM)_

_Garrick shrugs._

ðŸŽ± | Y35, RPretribution.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:41 PM)_

> I don't know and I don't care.

_Seth knees Jim in the back, prompting him to get up._

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:41 PM)_

_Garrick, upon finding the last officer, finds them cowering in the corner. He pretends to not notice them, taking interest in a desk fan._

> Interesting...

_Garrick pockets the desk fan._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:41 PM)_

> I'll airlock you later.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:41 PM)_

> You think you can just burst into a police station and plan to get away with it?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:41 PM)_

> Yes.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:41 PM)_

> Yeah.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:41 PM)_

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:41 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett look in the ship's fridge and grab some strawberries he ended up buying?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:41 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:42 PM)_

> Yeah.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:42 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is the co-worker giving up?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:42 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase no, Zander.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:42 PM)_

_Garrick rotates slowly, sliding his view towards the police officer. He speaks monotone, almost like a robot._

> Aha! Found you.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:42 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does the cyborg want to check out the crew's ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:42 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, PlasmaPerson.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:43 PM)_

> So, what's your plan?
> Sell me to some hot-shot off-planet?

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:43 PM)_

_Garrick overhears the others and speaks loudly so they could hear him._

> Yes.
> Why else would we do this?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:44 PM)_

_Asier grabs Jim's arm._

> I mean.
> He could be useful to us!

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:44 PM)_

_Emmett takes out some ingredients to make a cake._

> Strawberry shortcake.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:44 PM)_

_Garrick sighs._

> Oh, c'mon. He'd never help us after this. I say we sell 'em.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:45 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does the co-worker have a gun?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:45 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, TheBlade.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:45 PM)_

> What if we force him to work for us?

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:45 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does the co-worker start twerking, causing an AK-47 implant in her rear to activate?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:45 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:46 PM)_

_Jim, having been brought to the same room with the co-worker by the others, ducks immediately._

> Janis, WHAT THE FUCK?!

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:46 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Bail jump out of the way?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Zander.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:46 PM)_

_Tons of bullets phase directly through Garrick, who sat there, confused._

> Huh?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:46 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Asier use his shape shifting to dodge the bullets?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yeah, PlasmaPerson.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:47 PM)_

> Can we just kill her?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:47 PM)_

_Asier shape-shifts into various shapes reminiscent of swiss cheese._

> Shape-shifting! Take that!

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:48 PM)_

> Back off, guys, you dont need to kill... ah... a twerking, ass blasting, cop or whatever that is?
> Again, what the fuck, Janis?!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:48 PM)_

_Garrick grabs Bail by the scruff of his vest, taking him back to the station._

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:50 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does the rim of Bail's hat get shot instead, doing no damage to him?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:50 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:50 PM)_

> There is medical gear in the back of the station.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:52 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Did Bail's conveniently placed revolver instead get shot?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:52 PM)_

_Emmett hums to himself happily, grabbing a cocktail umbrella._

> Put a little umbrella on top of the little cake.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:53 PM)_

_Seth pats Jim on the back when Janis was somehow reloading._

> Thank you.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:54 PM)_

_Emmett claps._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Jun-18 03:54 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth go to the surveillance room and start destroying everything?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:54 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:56 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Jim have a phone and start texting for backup?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:56 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yay, TheBlade.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 03:57 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett start baking more strawberry-related meals for the rest of them?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:57 PM)_

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 03:57 PM)_

_Garrick follows Seth, seeing Seth start to destroy everything._

> Nice.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 03:57 PM)_

_Jim, through handcuffs, manages to slide a phone from his pocket to his hand, and covertly starts texting._

_Jim mutters to himself._

> Just need some time...

_He decides to distract Seth, looking over to him._

> Hey, so who are you?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 03:59 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does this nonsense stop and the crew decides to go back to the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 03:59 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | TheBlade says yes, PlasmaPerson.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:01 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do any police manage to respond to the text?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 04:01 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, TheBlade.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 04:01 PM)_

> All right, I'm out.

_Asier winks and starts to phase outside the station._

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:02 PM)_

> You aren't just going to leave me here are you?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 04:02 PM)_

> Unless you want to come with us...

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 04:02 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Garrick go to the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 04:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 1! No, RPretribution.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:02 PM)_

> Well, I kind of just texted for backup...

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 04:02 PM)_

> Alright, fine.

_Garrick folds his hands and sits down, pouting._

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:03 PM)_

> And I did shoot a guy...

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 04:03 PM)_

_Emmett, getting impatient from what he was hearing, blurts out into his comms._

> Asier, tell him to join or be sold on the dark web.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 04:03 PM)_

> I don't want anything to do with that ship.

_Garrick sticks his tongue out, still facing Janis, who fell unconscious from the recoil from the gun implant._

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:03 PM)_

> You know what? fuck it, im tired of this stupid life.
> Take me with you.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 04:03 PM)_

> It probably smells like strawberry pastries, based on what I'm hearing.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 04:04 PM)_

> We'll leave you if you dont come with us, Garrick.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 04:04 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Garrick feel a hunger for strawberry-related pastries?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 04:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Wait to ask this again, Zander.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 04:04 PM)_

_Garrick groans._

> Ugh, fine. I don't have anywhere else to go anyways.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:04 PM)_

> I can't stay here, I'm the only one here, well, aside from Janis, and there is no evidence of you.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 04:04 PM)_

> Then off we go!

_Asier takes out a sword, stabs Janis to make sure she was out permanently, and escorts Jim back to the ship._

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 04:04 PM)_

_Bail tips his hat to Jim as he enters, his hand bandaged from the burn he got from the shot to his gun._

> Well, welcome aboard. What's your name?

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:05 PM)_

> Jim, Jim Johnson. And yours?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 04:05 PM)_

_Asier butts in hyperactively._

> Asier!

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 04:05 PM)_

> I'm Bail, the engineer.
> Asier's the janitor.

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 04:06 PM)_

_Emmett was giddy over his strawberty goods._

> I made strawberries.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 04:06 PM)_

> No I'm not!

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 04:06 PM)_

> I MADE STRAWBERRIES!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 04:06 PM)_

> I refuse to be the janitor!

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 04:06 PM)_

_Garrick enters the ship and pokes Asier._

> What ARE you, anyhow?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 04:07 PM)_

> I'm a shade walker.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:07 PM)_

> Well, since we are properly introduced, can someone get me out of these cuffs?

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 04:07 PM)_

> You need to take a strawberry meal in order to be apart of the crew, guys.
> Here's what I got.

_Emmett smiles and lists out his confectionary goods he's baked._

> Strawberry shortcake with an umbrella on top.
> Rhubarb pie.
> Chocolate-covered strawberries.
> Stawberry bread.
> Strawberry muffins.
> Strawberry angel food dessert.
> Strawberry ice cream.
> Strawberry trifle.
> And a strawberry smoothie.
> Take your pick!
> I'm taking my strawberry shortcake.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 04:08 PM)_

_Garrick grabs the strawberry muffins, disgusted from the smell, but pleasantly surprised from the taste._

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:08 PM)_

_Jim grabs the strawberry angel food dessert, though he is still handcuffed._

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 04:09 PM)_

_Bail grabs the strawberry ice cream and rubs a bit on his mantle. The ice cream seems to evaporate, but, Bail still managed to taste it._

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:09 PM)_

> How do you expect me to eat this with handcuffs on?

_Jim holds his handcuffs out._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 04:09 PM)_

_Asier grabs and eats some of the chocolate-covered stawberries, making him even more hyperactive._

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 04:09 PM)_

> I'll uncuff you, don't worry.

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 04:10 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does the crew uncuff Jim yet?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 04:10 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 04:11 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Asier uncuff Jim?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 04:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, PlasmaPerson.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:12 PM)_

> Well since none of you will uncuff me...

@Magic8Ball Does Jim break the cuffs?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 04:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yeah, TheBlade.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 04:12 PM)_

> I would, but it's not my turn.

_Garrick blinks at you, the reader._

> Whatever that means.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 04:12 PM)_

> Oh, you could've done that the whole time?

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 04:12 PM)_

> I was literally just going to uncuff you man.
> By the way, I'm Emmett.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:12 PM)_

> I mean, no one was making a move, so i just broke them...

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 04:13 PM)_

> Co-captain and more or less the pilot of this crew.
> I wasn't one of the assholes who decided to shoot you guys up.
> Pleasure to meet you.

_Emmett holds out a hoof to Jim._

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:15 PM)_

> My pleasure as well.

_Jim shakes Emmett's hoof._

> So where are we heading, anyhow?

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 04:17 PM)_

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Jun-18 04:17 PM)_

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:17 PM)_

_With the angel food dessert in his mouth, Jim looks around for his shotgun._

> Has anyone seen my shotgun?

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 04:18 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett close the ship hatch and start it up?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 04:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 20! Yes, Zander.

> Sweet, a mug.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:21 PM)_

> Thats my mug...

_Jim frowns._

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 04:21 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes and mutters sarcastically._

> Helpful.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:21 PM)_

> You broke into a police station... and stole a mug...

_Jim facepalms._

**Brakia** _(25-Jun-18 04:22 PM)_

> Yep.
> It's my new favorite mug!

_Bail poses with the mug happily._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 04:22 PM)_

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 04:22 PM)_

> Hey, just be glad you got something.

_Garrick looks into a mirror dead-eyed, devastated from the events that occurred at the police station._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Jun-18 04:23 PM)_

> Yeah, now we can heal things.
> Maybe I can heal your PTSD, Garrick.

**RPretribution** _(25-Jun-18 04:23 PM)_

_Garrick speaks softly, distraught._

> Please...

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:24 PM)_

> t!choose Jim stole 0D | Jim stole 10 D | Jim stole 20 D | Jim stole 50 D | Jim stole 100D | Jim stole 200D | Jim stole a Pocket pistol

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett launch the ship towards the continent of North America?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 04:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:24 PM)_

> Guys, what about those guys I called?

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 04:24 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Are we being chased?

**Magic8Ball** _(25-Jun-18 04:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 11! Yes, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(25-Jun-18 04:25 PM)_

> I dont think they have a shop yet
> A ship I mean.
> Wonder what happened to Janis...

**Zander** _(25-Jun-18 04:27 PM)_
