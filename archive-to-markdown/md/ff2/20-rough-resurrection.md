t!8ball Does Emmett grab Sanya's flower as a keepsake?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Better not tell you now, Brakia.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Emmett frowns._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris wake up now?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

> ... Ow...

_Lying in the doused medical bed, Iris feels her head from the night prior._

> My head hurts so bad...

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

t!8ball Is Seth asleep on a couch right next to Iris's bed?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

> Sanya, why did you have to be a floran?

_Emmett groans and bares his teeth solemnly._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:15 PM)_

> Stricken by the supposed Dreadlord...

_Emmett rolls his eyes._

> An edgelord.

t!8ball Does Emmett stand himself up, picking off her flower from his cheek?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Zander.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett pick up the damn flower?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Brakia.

t!8ball Does Emmett pee on Sanya's flower?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

_Iris's arms seize up, her veins popping._

> It feels like my veins are on fire...

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:20 PM)_

_Emmett picks himself up before realizing he's managed to piss himself, and atop of Sanya's flower nonetheless. Emmett cringes and picks up the flower, repulsed at himself._

> Shit, shit. Haven't pissed in a while...

t!8ball Does Emmett walk over to the restroom to clean the flower off?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:20 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett suck up the pee with his magical mop in the restroom?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth wake up and call one of his friends?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

_Seth, still on the couch in the medbay, calls up a drow elf friend of his._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

_Deyner answers his phone from his cabin._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

_Seth smiles as Deyner answers his call._

> Hey Deyner, how's it going?

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

_Garrick flies around the ship, phasing through various walls._

> Vroom...

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

> I'm such an unlucky bastard...

_Emmett sighs and admires Sanya's flower._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

> Hello, Seth.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

_Emmett thinks about what he just said._

> Er, not a bastard...

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

> How are you?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

> Something though.
> I'll cherish you, Sanya.

_Emmett slowly pets the flower's petals, giving it a sniff to feel something._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:27 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris have a red tree-like veiny tattoo-ish pattern on her inner arms now?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:27 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Jelsafan0.

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:27 PM)_

> I'm good. Sorry if the connection is a bit furry...

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:27 PM)_

> Even if this is what's left of you...

_Emmett sneezes, the plant pheremones not affecting him as much as when Sanya was alive._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:27 PM)_

_Iris examines her firey arms with a sort of horrified fascination._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:27 PM)_

> We're a little bit far in deep space...

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:28 PM)_

_Deyner watches the news on his holovision, seeing a newscaster talk about some massive explosion on the Outer Rim._

> It's good. Did you guys see any sort of explosion?

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:28 PM)_

> No clue, we were asleep.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:28 PM)_

_Emmett sinks down to his knees._

> I just feel so shitty without you.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

_Iris follows the lines on her arm with her finger, discovering that they connect in between her shoulder blades at a single point._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

_Seth eyeballs Iris, noticing her glowing veins._

> Did you ever get into the Queen's Royal Space Navy?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

_Iris starts to rub at a line, and discovers that it won't come off. It's just a part of her skin._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

> No, I was already part of the Queen's personal guard...
> But i failed and shes wondering the cosmos like me. Hopefully she's safe...

_Deyner sighs._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

> What a shame, the Queen hardly ever visited your planet.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:31 PM)_

> Yeah, she always sent her ambassadors.

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

_Seth scoffs._

> The Royal Navy has better perks anyways.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

_Iris sighs heavily, and looks at the tubes and needles attached to her skin. She doesn't feel as though they're necessary, anymore._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

_Deyner audibly weeps, looking over the rubble of his fallen planet from the confines of his corvette._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

_Emmett sticks Sanya's flower in his ear and leaves the restroom._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

_Iris carefully pulls the IV tubes out one by one, feeling oddly empty._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

t!8ball Is Deyner likely to survive and find another planet with only 75 percent oxygen reserves?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

t!8ball Does Chomsky, casually eating yogurt, walk over to Iris

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

> Well. Guess I should eat...

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

_When the last tube comes out, a sudden rush of emotion hits Iris. Tears blur her vision._
_She quickly forces them back. Not anymore._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth say goodbye and hangup?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

_Iris notices Chomsky enter the medbay, albeit without any yogurt._

> Uh, hi, Chomsky.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

> Yo.

_Chomsky snaps at Iris's arm and strikes a pose._

> Sick tattoo. Where'd you get it?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:35 PM)_

_Iris clears her throat to rid herself of any visible emotion._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:35 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett trudge over to the kitchen, grabbing himself some grass?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:35 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:35 PM)_

> ... The fire magic in my body.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:35 PM)_

_Deyner passes out in his phone booth in his corvette floating around space._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:35 PM)_

_Emmett opens up a bundle of grass and smiles softly._

> Comfort food...

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:35 PM)_

> Uhh, okay.
> Where's everyone else?

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 03:36 PM)_

t!8ball Does the darkness start to drain from Sanya's flower?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:36 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Brakia.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:36 PM)_

_Deyner quickly wakes up from his nap and empties his pockets to find stuff to invent something with. Because of corvette's fluctuating oxygen problem, he quickly falls back asleep._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

> I don't know. I just woke up...

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

_Emmett starts stuffing more than his daily dosage of grass into his mouth._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

t!8ball Is Iris able to stand without trouble?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Jelsafan0.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_Chomsky shrugs, watching Iris stand._

> Yeah, me too. I fell asleep reading Emmett's book.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner wake up?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Deyner.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Iris stands, feet gently touching the floor._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris trip and fall while screaming "I've fallen and I can't get up"?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Bagelwrecker.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Deyner wakes up again and looks around pulling a screwdriver, a couple of gears, and a broken radio out of his pocket._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Chomsky rushes to Iris's side and helps her back up._

> Woah, you ok?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

_Iris groans and dusts her swimsuit off._

> I'm fine. God is just stupid sometimes.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

_Emmett starts to hear something faint from the flower._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

> I feel the same way...

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

> `Sanya's Flower`: Em...

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

_Iris stands easily._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

> `Sanya's Flower`: Emmett..

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

_Emmett looks around, unsure who or what is speaking to him._

> Who? What?

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

_Chomsky grabs a cup of yogurt from his coat pocket. He takes a sip of it and rejoins Iris._

> This yogurt sucks. I hate blueberry.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

> Hello...?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

_Iris winces and heads out of the medbay._

> ... Follow me.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

> Um...

_Chomsky watches as Iris leaves him._

> Okay...

_Chomsky speedwalks to catch up to Iris._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett start to shiver?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Zander.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

_Deyner checks his oxygen gauge and sees that it is low._

> Damnit...

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

> `Sanya's Flower`: Emmett... Please...

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

> Yes?

_Emmett is still looking around for the source of the voice, ignorant of the fact that Sanya's flower is still in his ear._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

_`Sanya's Flower`: The flower's voice grows more strained, as if Sanya's life is hanging in the balance and growing more faint by the minute._

> `Sanya's Flower`: Help...

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

> Where are we going? The ship's not that big...

_Chomsky grows a bit nervous as he follows Iris, unsure whether Iris and the others have learned his secrets._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

_Iris starts to walk towards the kitchen. She hums and eyeballs Emmett._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

> Oh god, what happened in here?!

_Chomsky kicks a couple muffins, in awe of the sheer amount of baked goods filling up the room._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

_Emmett's mouth is a mess of green from the grass he just devoured._

> Oh. Hey Chomsky.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

_Iris looks down at the floor and scratches her arm out of embarrassment._

> ... They were flirting with me...

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

_Chomsky ignores Iris's statement and waves at Emmett._

> Hey Emmett.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

_Emmett holds his ears closer to his head to test whether the voice is nearby and eyeballs Chomsky._

> Hey.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

> This room sickens me...

_Chomsky stomps on a muffin._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

> I'm sorry...
> I made these.

_Iris frowns and picks up a couple of them._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

> `Sanya's Flower`: The... Greenroom...

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

> What about the greenroom?

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

> I mean... I'd probably eat them if I liked blueberries if that's any consolation...

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

_Iris gives Emmett a faint smile._

> ... Oh, hello Emmett.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

> `Sanya's Flower`: Plant... Me...

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

_Seth swings into the kitchen with the others and completely ignores the muffins littering the floor._

> Hey Emmett, you got any weed?

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

t!8ball Is Emmett's speech suspicious at all to Chomsky and iris?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Concentrate and ask again, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

_Emmett sticks another assload of grass in his mouth as Seth asks this._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

> Oh.

_Seth closes in on Emmett, his hands posed to steal the grass from Emmett's mouth._

> Gimme'!

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

_Emmett backs off from Seth, uncovering his ears._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris speak loud enough for Emmett to hear this time?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

_Iris gives Emmett a little wave._

> Hello, Emmett.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

_Emmett gives a muffled speech from the grass that's in his mouth._

> HRF EURIS!

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

_Iris stifles a snort at Emmett's response._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

_Chomsky backs up from Emmett, disgusted._

> Geez' man, swallow first. You're gonna spit on me.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner craft a working emergency beacon?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Deyner.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

_Emmett purposely spits some grass at Chomsky._

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Deyner.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner pass out due to lack of oxygen again?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Deyner.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

_Chomsky, visibly disgusted, wipes off the chewed grass from his coat._

> I could kill you in an instant.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

_Iris snickers silently, highly amused._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

_Emmett swallows._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

t!8ball Does Chomsky bend over and eat the grass Emmett spit out?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Sources say no, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

> Fuck you too then. My Squan just died.

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

> You mean your mistress?

_Seth gives a toothy grin._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_Iris flinches, turning a bit. Tears work their way into her eyes and she shuts them quickly, trying to force the tears back._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

> Oh. Sorry to hear, I guess. That was still pretty gross though.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

_Emmett raises an eyebrow angrily at Seth._

> Mistress?!

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett start to go to the Greenroom?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Brakia.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

_Iris takes a deep breath and turns to exit the room._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

> `Sanya's Flower`: Emmett... Quickly...

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

_Chomsky abruptly leaves the kitchen._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

> Hm? Oh. Chomsky.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

> Hey.

_Chomsky looks around the halls they are headed through._

> Uh...
> Who have you been talking to?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

> This flower is telling me to plant it.
> So, I'm doing what it asks.

_Emmett shrugs._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

> Ooookay. Talking flowers...

_Chomsky frowns._

> That's not crazy at all...

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris wander aimlessly around the ship, not paying attention to where she's going, until she suddenly realizes she's at the pool again?

t!8ball Does anyone on the ship notice the Deyner's beacon's signal?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Better not tell you now, Deyner.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

> I'm going, yeesh!

_Emmett increases his speed and makes it to the greenroom._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

_Iris frowns and sits down, sighing deeply._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett plant the flower and water it?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Iris gazes at her reflection in the pool._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Chomsky gives a half-smile, kind of ambivalent over the signifance of the situation._

> It's a cool flower, I guess.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

> It's what she would have wanted, you know?

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

_Chomsky gives Emmett a confused look._

> What she wanted? Who?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

_Emmett wines a little._

> Sanya.
> My Squan.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:59 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:59 PM)_

> So Sanya is... dead? How did that happen?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:59 PM)_

_Iris looks up, and stands. She glances at the pool one last time._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

_Emmett pats some soil around Sanya's flower and sighs._

> Bipolarism.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

> Oh. The Dread thing...

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

_Iris shakes off her memory from the previous day, making her way to the cockpit._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

> Sanya was embodied by some force who claimed to be a god. They were trying to kill Iris.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

_Deyner's beacon keeps beeping a white light over and over again._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

_Chomsky shivers from the thought of Dread._

t!8ball Does Sanya's flower start to grow?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

> `Sanya's Flower`: Thank... You...

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

> So Hector put her down.... Unfortunately...

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

_Chomsky mumbles to himself._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

_The flower stops wilting and starts to grow._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

_Garrick appears in the greenroom after getting tired of pretending to be a car._

> Heyo.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

t!choose flower grows super fast | takes several turns

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | PlasmaPerson, I pick flower grows super fast!

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris know how to operate a tractor beam?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Jelsafan0.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_Chomsky backs up from the growing flower._

> Okay, that's definitely unnatural.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris learn how to use the tractor beam?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Deyner.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_There is now a very large green thing growing deep in the soil of the greenroom._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_Iris, upon noticing the beacon, scrambles around to find the tractor beam controls. Instead, she finds the manual for the ship!_

> Ah! A manual!

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

_Garrick points a big finger at the plant growing in the soil._

> Woah! There's a very large thing deep in the soil!

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

> Let's see here... and...

_Iris presses a couple buttons and starts up the tractor beam onto Deyner's corvette._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

_Emmett tilts his head and observes the plant growing. He eyeballs the curves forming._

> That thing looks.... Oddly feminine.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

_Chomsky sweats from the strange growth occurring._

> Uh, should we pull it out?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

> Don't.... Don't startle a sleeping lady.

_Emmett peers over to Chomsky._

> Be courteous.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

> Won't she suffocate?

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_Garrick smiles widely at the prospect of killing whatever is growing in the soil._

> Pull it out.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

> No. We'd only hurt her!

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_Garrick shrugs._

> That's fine.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

> Alright...

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_Chomsky, Emmett, and Garrick all hear a faint, gruff voice._

> Can you bring me some clothes?

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick pull it out?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, RPretribution.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

> Um...

_Chomsky covers his eyes and leaves._

> I'll go get some for you.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Emmett gives a sly peek at Sanya and then also heads out the greenroom momentarily._

> Let me.

t!8ball Does Emmett go and grab some clothes from his dresser?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Zander.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

_Emmett returns with his trademark red burgundy sweater and sweatpants. He covers his eyes to be respectful when handing the clothes to Sanya._

> I mean, they aren't much, but they're something. Here.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> Can you all leave the room now?

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_Chomsky sits around the doorway and lights a cigarette._

> Gladly.

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> Yeah...

_Garrick backs up through the greenroom wall and meets up with Chomsky._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_Emmett thinks for a moment, tears slowly dripping beneath his hooves. He reluctantly leaves Sanya unattended and hangs out with the others just outside._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

_Sanya gets out of the dirt and tries to get dressed._

t!8ball Do the clothes fit?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Better not tell you now, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

t!8ball does Chomsky join iris to investigate the beacon

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_With a lit cigarette in his mouth, Chomsky goes back to the kitchen to sit among the muffins._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Garrick joins Iris to investigate the beacon because the universe hates Chomsky._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Iris is trying her hardest to grab the beacon with the ship's tractor beam._

> ... Hey...

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

> Yo'.

_Garrick enter the cockpit with a lollipop, mystery flavor._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

_Chomsky builds a throne out of the muffins and sits in it. He uses a muffin as an ashtray of sorts. After a couple of seconds, he starts sinking in the throne._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 9, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

_Determined, Iris finally grabs ahold of the corvette and starts to pull it towards the ship._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

> Could you not?

_Seth bursts into the cockpit and tries to bump Iris away from the console with his hips._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

_The muffins are so comfy that Chomsky doesn't bother moving._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

_Iris pushes against Seth with her weight._

> Please move!

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

> I gotta do some software and hardware updates that Emmett forgot to do!

_Seth manages to push Iris out of the way and starts messing with the tractor beam._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

t!8ball Does the tractor beam manage to pull Deyner completely in before Seth messes with it too much?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Deyner.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

> Fuck off, Seth!

_Iris continues to try and push Seth out of the way to no avail._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

> School jail!

_Garrick takes out a bird cage with the bottom taken out and fits it over Seth's head._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

_Iris laughs._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

_Deyner dreams about becoming a master bounty hunter as the tractor beam takes his corvette._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does the tractor beam break?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

> Oh boy...

_Iris glares at Seth angrily._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

> Look what you did, retard!

_Seth flicks Iris._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Deyner's corvette, upon the tractor beam breaking, causes Deyner to hit the windshield._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

> Don't touch the fucking controls next time.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Iris flips off Seth and heads to the ship airlock._

> Screw off. I'm gonna go help.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Deyner slowly slides across the windshield._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

> The shirt fits, but the pants are a bit small.
> Thanks, Emmett.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Emmett, sitting around the doorway to the greenroom, turns to speak to Sanya._

> Sorry!

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Seth speaks into his comms watch._

> Emmett, get some spare parts for the tractor beam when you're free, Iris broke it while I was doing some updates.

_Seth groans angrily, glaring as Iris leaves._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Garrick, floating outside of the ship, points at Deyner, who is still smushed against the windshield of his corvette._

> Is this guy new? He seems to like windows.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> I'm a little small, as you know...

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Deyner continues to slide for a good amount of time._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> Yeah, I know.

_Sanya tries her hardest to stretch out Emmett's pants. She manages to rip some of the threads out before she quits trying._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Emmett's more focused on Sanya, considering that he's turned off his communications watch._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick notice and do nothing to help Deyner?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, RPretribution.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Deyner continues to slide and is knocked out from the lack of oxygen in his corvette. There's roughly only five percent oxygen left!_

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett peek into the greenroom?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Seth exhales as he doesn't receive a response from Emmett._

> Poo butt.

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

> Eh, he'll be fine.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya leave the greenroom?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

> They're wearable.

_Sanya exits the greenroom and unintentionally hits Emmett's snout with her elbow._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

_Garrick flies out to the other side of the corvette and pushes it with all his might. It only takes a bit of force to move his ship over to the docking port._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

> Ow...

_Emmett holds his snout._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

_Deyner nearly slides off his windshield._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

> But that's good...

_Emmett looks up at Sanya with teary eyes and a curious smile._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

> Oh, sorry...

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

> You're fine...

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner's ship smack into the Panty Slingshot and dock due to airlock stuff?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, PlasmaPerson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

> Ugh...

_Seth heads out to the airlock, not wanting any stowaways to join his crew._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Deyner floats unconsciously in his ship._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Iris walks over to the door, opens the docking bay, and grabs Deyner from his ship._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

> Are you Sanya?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris slap Deyner, waking him up?

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

> Yes.

_Sanya tilts her head, wondering how Emmett would react._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris slap Deyner, waking him up?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Better not tell you now, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Emmett rubs his goat eyes._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

> Wake up! Live!

_Iris shakes Deyner's head._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner wake up and see the stranger?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Deyner.

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth airlock the trash compactor, thus airlocking Deyner and Iris?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Bagelwrecker.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_Deyner wakes up and looks around the airlock room._

> Where am I?

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> I'm not sure how florans do that, but all florans can revive themselves by getting someone re-planting their flower...

_Sanya furrows her brow._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> Who are you?

_Deyner looks into Iris's fiery gaze._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> I'm Iris. You're on the ship.

_Iris helps Deyner stand up and takes him out of the airlock room._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_Garrick re-joins Emmett and Sanya._

> What if someone cuts off your flower?

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> What ship?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_Iris shifts her hair to reveal her pointy elf ears._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_Emmett starts to hug Sanya tightly, relieved she's back from the dead. Tears stream from his eyes._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> I'm just curious. Not like I'd do it...

_Garrick gives a sinister smile._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> But since it's a plant-eat-plant world, no one really plants other people's flowers...

_Sanya sighs and hugs Emmett back._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> I don't know. It's just the ship...

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_`Phonebooth`: The phonebooth in the corvette starts ringing._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Deyner has a puzzled look as he tries to understand what type of elf Iris is._

> You're a elf but you dont look like a drow, or a snow elf?

_Deyner scoffs and speaks with a gruff, venomous voice._

> Or even a high elf?

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_`Phonebooth`: The phonebooth starts ringing louder._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Sanya looks down and is a bit irked from Emmett's lack of pants, given that he was still in his swim trunks._

> Where are your pants?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

_Emmett chuckles and sniffles._

> We went swimming before all of that bullshit went down...

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> High... elf...

_Iris recoils, flashbacks of her discriminatory childhood coming back._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> Oh yeah. I forgot.

_Sanya is starting to get tired of the hugging, especially given how bad Emmett was starting to smell in his piss-stained trunks._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

_Iris composes herself._

> I'm half light elf, half archidemon.

_Iris states harshly, looking down at Deyner._

> And I just saved your life.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> Wait!

_Sanya prods Emmett to stop the hugging._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

_`Phonebooth`: PHONEBOOTH RINGING INTENSIFIES_

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> How's Iris?!

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

_Emmett finally lets go of Sanya._

> Iris is fine.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> I'm sorry if I offended you. I did not mean to...

_Deyner frowns._

> Thank you for saving me.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> I just was concerned for you...

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> .. It's fine...

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> I know. I'm sorry.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> You really mean a lot to me...

_Emmett wipes his eyes._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> The others are that way.

_Iris points towards the greenroom._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick go into the room with Iris and Deyner?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, RPretribution.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> I have other things to do.

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> Boring...

_Garrick leaves Sanya and Emmett, not caring that Sanya was just revived._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> Who are the others?

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> You did too.

_Sanya looks beyond Emmett and scans the vicinity for Iris._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> Try finding out.

_Iris flashes out in the direction of the greenroom._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

_Deyners shakes his head._

> Wait... are you really a half-light elf? I thought those people were just from stories?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth get a call from an Elvish stock investor?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Zander.

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

> Hey, it's window guy.

_Garrick takes out a squeegee._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

> No. We were real. But now I'm all that's left...

_Iris gives Garrick a glare._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

> Ummmm...

_Deyner, confused by the tool Garrick is holding, questions him._

> Who are you?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

_Iris sighs heavily._

> Good luck.

_She keeps to herself, reminded once again of Dread's words._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya go off to find Iris?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

> I'll be back.

_Sanya pats Emmett's head and leaves him to find Iris._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

_Iris sighs, turns away, and starts to head back to her room. She is truly alone._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

_Seth groans and answers the phone._

> Hello, this is Seth Im'K'Inki speaking.

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

> Your worst nightmare. But you can call me Garrick.

_Garrick tosses the squeegee away and holds out his hand._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

_Emmett looks down at himself._

> I really should get some pants on...

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

t!8ball Does Chomsky toss a muffin at Deyner in greeting?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

_Emmett sniffs himself and is revolted._

> Rather, I should just take a shower...

_Emmett leaves to go grab some clothes and take a shower._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

> `Stock Broker`: Hello? Is this Seth speaking? I have a deal of a lifetime for you!

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

_Garrick, not at all offended that Deyner did not take his hand, pulls it back._

> Where'd you even come from?
> Besides space.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

_Chomsky, in the living block with all the others, flicks a muffin in Deyner's direction._

> Hey, another person to die in crazy adventures. Cool.

_Chomsky gives an odd frown._

> We have fun.

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

> What do you want? Trying to manage a crew here.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

_Deyner looks away dramatically._

> A place that is no longer...

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

_Sanya enters the hallway to her and Iris's room._

> Iris? Where did you go?

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

_Garrick takes out some pink fuzzy handcuffs._

> Chonky, we should totally enslave this guy. Iris doesn't seem to like him.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

> T'was destroyed by a madman on a quest for power.

_Deyner is taken aback by Garrick's suggestion of enslaving him._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Emmett grabs a fresh Elven military sweater and some gray sweatpants. The usual._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Iris steps into the doorway of her room, and leans heavily against it, back to the hallway._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

> `Stock Broker`: What if I told you I could get you 700 million Ducketts just from buying into the Elven Expo stock?!

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Deyner growls at Garrick and pulls his blades._

> You may try. But I am no one's slave.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Chomsky pulls out his flamethrower. No one is enslaving anyone._

> Wanna' run that name by me again, Garlic?

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Garrick is unfazed by Chomsky and Deyner's threats._

> ... You guys realize I'm incorporeal, right?

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

> Yeah, that's a fat chance. You're just trying to scam me, aren't you?

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

> Iris?

_Sanya looks about the hallway, seemingly unable to find Iris._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

_Tears begin to stream down Iris's face as she slides down the wall, to be on the floor._

t!8ball Does Iris begin to sob, curling into fetal position?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Jelsafan0.

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

> Chonky. That's your new nickname. What do you think?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

_Emmett passes by Iris as he heads for the shower._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

> Or when he is looking. I kinda do that for a living.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

_Iris does as told._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 05:01 PM)_

_Sanya grabs her sword from the ground nearby._

_Iris looks around the bathroom, kneeling down on a rug._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

_Emmett closes the door behind Iris and kneels down with her. He exhales, letting his poker face falter into one of frustration._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

_Iris gives a weird look, biting her tongue from the verbal slip she nearly had. Zander? That's not Emmett's name!_

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

_Sanya pulls out her blade, dread engulfing the sword._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 05:08 PM)_

_Emmett looks past Iris, realizing how silly he's being._

> It really sounds loud out there...

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

> `Pirate 2`: Hah hah ha! You obviously don't know how war works, eh kiddo'?

_`Pirate 2`: The pirate readies a shot with their hand cannon._

_Iris stares into Emmett's distracted eyes._

> I really didn't mean to make you feel left out.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 05:10 PM)_

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 05:12 PM)_

_Iris's mouth quivers._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 05:13 PM)_

_Emmett puts a hoof on Iris's knee._

> I'm glad you're back.

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 05:13 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth lube up his laser gun as he hears commotion from over the comms and start to head over to where the fight is happening?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 05:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 05:13 PM)_

_Iris nods and calms down._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 05:14 PM)_

_Danny, after having been in a long mission of his own without the others, leaves his room and speaks within his comms._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 05:14 PM)_

t!8ball Does one of the raiders run off with Danny's hammer?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 05:14 PM)_

_Danny taps into his watch._

> You guys aren't all dead, are you?

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 05:16 PM)_

> Oh!

_Seth notices the pirates racing around the ship causing havoc._

> Looks like fun times!
> This reminds me of a video I saw where a doctor tries to convince an evil missile contractor to be a good person and give himself up to the police and manages to kill him in a shootout for the greater good.

_Seth takes a deep breath and blinks._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 05:16 PM)_

_Iris holds Emmett's hoof._

> I'm sorry. For worrying you, I mean.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 05:17 PM)_

_Danny watches as a pirate runs down his hallway with a bunch of various electrical trinkets and goodies._

> Oh pirates, Hurrah!
> That explains it...

_Danny heads back into his room and grabs his hammer for protection. He doesn't plan to assist the others, but his safety is still paramount._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

_Danny speaks into his comms and closes his door once more, locking it._

> I will be retreating to my room now, if you need me just call, I may or may not come to help.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

_`Pirate 2`: The pirate jumps around and puts their hands to their ears, mocking Sanya._

> `Pirate 2`: That's cute! That's real cute, lil' lady!

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

_Sanya growls and grits her teeth._

> Do you know who I am?

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

_`Pirate 3`: The pirate laughs at Sanya's failed attack._

> `Pirate 3`: Was that supposed to hurt?!

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

_Emmett sighs, worrying a bit about what's going on outside._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

> I'm a floran. Do you know what that means?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 05:19 PM)_

_`Pirate 2`: The pirate winks at Sanya suggestively._

> `Pirate 2`: That you're an extra rare catch!

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 05:19 PM)_

_Sanya snarls._

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 05:19 PM)_

> `Pirate 3`: Don't know don't care, you're getting wasted just like your friend!

_`Pirate 3`: The pirate points to Deyner, believing they've killed him._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 05:19 PM)_

> Over and over again.

_Sanya prepares a strike, trying to tune herself with the Dreadsword._

> It's always the same!

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 05:19 PM)_

> `Pirate 2`: Some people will pay a real pretty penny for you!

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 05:20 PM)_

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 05:20 PM)_

_Emmett folds his arms, really wanting to take a shower._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 05:21 PM)_

_Iris replies stubbornly._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does Danny watch the fight with popcorn?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Platinum_Pathos.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

_Danny decides to leave his room and find the others. He sets up a lounge chair where Sanya and Chomsky are fending off the invader and chews on some popcorn._

> You con doo it!
> Whooo!

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

_`Pirate 2`: The pirate cackles over the other's sentiment._

> `Pirate 2`: In and out?! This is much more than in and out, you asshole!

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

_Danny laughs wholeheartedly._

> Should I save some of this popcorn for when you guys when you're done?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

_`Pirate 1`: After beating up Deyner senselessly, the pirate turns to see Danny relaxing in front of them._

> `Pirate 1`: "Wait a moment guys, we got a Popstar homebody here!

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

_Sanya glares at Danny._

> Just fucking help us, you fucking useless marshmallow of a crewmember!

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

_`Pirate 3`: The pirate manages to take out Matieu, who was dragged into the room by the others looting the ship._

> `Pirate 3`: That's another done, I thought you were supposed to be tough!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

> I told you to just ask when you needed help. Sheesh!

_Danny groans and lifts himself up from his lounge chair._

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

_`Pirate 3`: The pirate takes a finger to his throat and drags it across menacingly._

> `Pirate 3`: You're next plant girl!

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

_Sanya hisses._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

_Danny looks around at the others, not really wanting to help._

> Alright which of you is having the worst trouble?

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

_Danny readies his hammer._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 05:27 PM)_

_Emmett looks to the edge of his eyes at the sink._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 05:27 PM)_

_Iris gives him a funny look._

> What? Why?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 05:27 PM)_

_Danny viciously smears the racist pirate's face on the ground with his boot._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 05:36 PM)_

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 05:38 PM)_

_Emmett backs up to the shower._

> Iris, can I please take a shower? I mean... I'm pretty gross right now...

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Zander.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 05:54 PM)_

> Well, we should mutiny after this fight and all, of course.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 05:54 PM)_

_`Pirate 5`: A pirate manages to slip on the blood from the flatten pirate corpse on the ground and impales himself with his own blade._

> `Pirate 5`: S-such a klutz...

_Sanya huffs._

> Just.. Die...

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 05:56 PM)_

_`Pirate 6`: The last remaining pirate grins, having been looting and taking out the other crewmates while the others were fighting._

> `Pirate 6`: Maybe after I sell your petals on the black market...

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 05:56 PM)_

_Danny spins around, looking for his dropped popcorn._

> Guys! I can't find my popcorn!
> I don't know where it went!

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 05:56 PM)_

_Sanya looks at the bag of popcorn on the ground and kicks it away from herself._

> I don't like popcorn.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 05:57 PM)_

> Damn it, Sanya!

_Danny stomps angrily._

> Do I need to swallow you right here, right now!?

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 05:57 PM)_

_Sanya's eyes widen and she gives Danny the most bewildered look she could manage._

> I'm FUCKING SORRY?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 05:58 PM)_

_While the others are distracted, Seth manages to land a shot on the last remaining pirate. It doesn't kill, however it greatly injures them._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 05:58 PM)_

_Emmett suds his fur while in the shower, humming a Squoatopian tune._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 05:58 PM)_

_Danny screams into his watch._

> Emmett, we need to buy more popcorn!

_After not receiving a response immediately, Danny screams._

> I THINK MY COMMS WATCH IS BROKEN! FUCK!

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 05:58 PM)_

_Iris starts to wake up from the loud sound of water hitting the shower floor._

> ... Mmnm...

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 06:00 PM)_

_Emmett quiets down, thinking he's heard something._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:00 PM)_

_Danny sighs and looks back to Sanya._

> Hear me out, I could swallow you Sanya.
> Either that, or you order me some popcorn.
> Weigh your options carefully.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 06:00 PM)_

> That's fucking gross! No!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:01 PM)_

> I get to see how you taste. Haven't had salad in a while, so I imagine you're tasty.
> You get to relax and dissolve in my stomach.

_Danny shrugs._

> Sounds like a win-win to me.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 06:01 PM)_

> That's fucked up.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 06:01 PM)_

> ... Yeowza... my head.......

_Iris feels her head and tries to comprehend her surroundings._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 06:01 PM)_

_Seth admires his Desert Eagle._

> Man, this pirate battle sucks. This reminds me of a video... Actually, I've forgotten what it reminds me of already.
> Meh.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 06:02 PM)_

_Emmett, his face foamy with soap, peeks around the curtain._

> Oh! Heh. Morning.

_Embarrassed a bit, Emmett wraps the shower liner around his body._

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 06:02 PM)_

_`Pirate 6`: The pirate shoots at Seth, managing a torso plasma blast._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:03 PM)_

_Danny rolls his eyes._

> Fine... The side-effect you'll experience is that I'll get some of your powers.
> The taste is the main aspect of course though.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 06:03 PM)_

> ... G'mornin' Emmett...

_Iris groans, her brain not yet properly functioning._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:04 PM)_

_Danny taps his cheeks in thought._

> Well, I guess there are potato chips in my room, if that'll help you stay afloat.
> Or is that some form of cannibalism?

_Danny grins._

> Sanya, is that cannibalism?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 06:05 PM)_

_Iris finally wakes up, and realizes that she's in the bathroom with Emmett. She yelps and covers her eyes with her hands, her cheeks burning._

> AH!

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 06:05 PM)_

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 06:05 PM)_

_Sanya decapitates the last remaining pirate as he's focused on Seth. She pants and drops her sword, relieved the fighting is over._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 06:05 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes and goes back to scrubbing his face._

> Iris, I'm behind a curtain for a reason. Relax.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 06:07 PM)_

> I-I'm sorry!
> I didn't know you were showering!

_Iris's face becomes redder._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 06:07 PM)_

> Oh c'mon, chill Iris.

_Emmett blinks frequently, having gotten some suds in his eyes._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:07 PM)_

_Danny listens into Iris's comms, relieved that his comms watch is not entirely broken._

> Iris, stop being a pervert!

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 06:08 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector wake up?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 06:08 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, MultiTheDuck.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 06:08 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya collapse?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 06:08 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Ask again later, Brakia.

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 06:08 PM)_

_Hector wakes up in his room, checks his alarm clock, and groans._

> Ugh, I overslept again...

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 06:08 PM)_

_Iris attempts to chill._

> I'm chilling!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:08 PM)_

> Sanya, I have a really important question to ask.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 06:08 PM)_

_Sanya drops to her knees, still panting from the fight._

> What?

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:08 PM)_

> Is eating potatos considered cannibalism for you?

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 06:09 PM)_

_Sanya scoffs._

> No. What? That's kinda racist.
> I'm not a potato.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 06:09 PM)_

_Emmett finishes scrubbing up his face and stops the shower, grabbing a towel. He dries himself off and wraps the towel around his waist._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:09 PM)_

_Danny tilts his head._

> And what else qualifies as cannibalism?

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 06:09 PM)_

> Florans eating Florans...

_Sanya gestures to Danny, "are you stupid or something?"_

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:09 PM)_

_Danny persists, continuing to be irritating._

> Are you a carnivore?

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 06:09 PM)_

> Alright I'm up now, what did I...?

_Hector looks around for Matieu and sees that he isn't in his bed. He walks out into the hall, seeing the aftermath of the fight._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 06:09 PM)_

> Yes. Stop asking so many questions.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:10 PM)_

_Danny squares his chin with his fingers._

> Or does that mean you're a herbivore?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 06:10 PM)_

_Iris' hands remain tightly clamped over her eyes, shameful thoughts of hunky squoatling rump running through her mind._

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 06:10 PM)_

_Hector notices Sanya kneeling on the ground around a bunch of pirate corpses._

> Wait, I thought you died?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 06:11 PM)_

_Emmett groans, standing before Iris in his towel._

> If we're going to be in... Whatever relationship we have right now, you really need to loosen up. I'm not showing my assets to you or anything.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 06:11 PM)_

_Iris shivers and sighs in acceptance._

> ... Okay.... should I open my eyes...?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 06:12 PM)_

> Yeah. I'm wearing a towel.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:12 PM)_

_Danny furrows his brow, speaking into his comms._

> No, you pervert!

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 06:12 PM)_

_Iris uncovers her eyes, her face still burning a bright red. She sees a wet squoatling standing before her, clad in a lemon towel._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 06:13 PM)_

_Deyner wakes up, his head pounding from the ambush._

> What happened? Where are the pirates?

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:13 PM)_

_Danny, still thinking Iris was being a pervert over the comms, has an idea._

> We need a hot tub.
> Or a spa.
> Would be amazing.

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 06:13 PM)_

_Hector makes his way to Deyner, making sure to step around the numerous corpses._

> Oh my, you look in bad shape, can you stand?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 06:13 PM)_

_Emmett gives Iris a soggy smile._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 06:14 PM)_

_Iris gives Emmett a soft smile, her heart beating quickly._

> ... Hi...

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 06:14 PM)_

_Emmett puts a hoof on his hip._

> Hey...

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 06:14 PM)_

> I'm fine, just oxygen deprivation got to me, I guess.

_Deyner wobbles as he tries to stand._

> I'm Deyner. And you are?

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 06:14 PM)_

> Hello, Hector. I'm back from the dead.

_Sanya's body gives and she struggles to keep herself upright._

> But, I don't think I will be for long...

_Sanya collapses to the ground._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:15 PM)_

_Danny heads to the kitchen pantry and finds a lot of the food missing, much of it covering the floor alongside the muffins._

> When is our next step to the store?

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 06:15 PM)_

> Hector, nice to meet you. let's see if I can't fix you up...

_Hector holds out all 6 of his arms for a handshake._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:15 PM)_

> The pirates kind of took half of our food supply...

_Danny's stomach rumbles loudly. He re-enters the living block with the others._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 06:15 PM)_

_Deyner continues to hold his head, struggling to stand._

> Hector, do you know where a doctor is?

_Deyner shakes all of Hector's hands with his ice cold hand._

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

> I'm the doctor of my ship, my nurse is unavailable, as you can see.

_Hector shows off the unconscious and bruised Matieu behind him._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

> How's uh...

_Iris looks away._

> How are things?

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

_Hector eyeballs Danny, knowing that Deyner is out of commission._

> Can you help me move Sanya to the medbay?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

_Emmett adjusts his towel and lifts himself atop of the sink countertop. He continues to smile._

> Wet and refreshing. You?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

_Iris gives an awkward chuckle._

> Uh... a little uh... humid.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

_Deyner stumbles forward._

> If you want, I can freeze her solid. If she is sick it slows it down...

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

_Danny lifts a finger to Hector._

> Or, I could eat Sanya. How about that?

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

_Hector takes out a stretcher, ignoring Danny's comment._

> She to be looks in bad condition...

_Hector looks over to Deyner._

> I can fix you up after I stabilize her.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

_Danny's stomach rumbles angrily._

> Still taste...

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 06:17 PM)_

_Hector groans and grabs Sanya from the ground._

> No don't do that, just help me put her on this stretcher.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 06:17 PM)_

_Iris, still uncomfortable, backs up from Emmett and towards the door._

> I think I'm gonna just... go... to my room... and take a nap.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 06:17 PM)_

_Deyner looks around._

> Where is the captain of this ship? I have a score to settle with him...

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:17 PM)_

> Fine...

_Deyner sighs and helps Hector lift Sanya onto the stretcher._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 06:17 PM)_

> You just took a nap, silly.

_Emmett frowns a bit._

> Just stick in here. Why not? The humidity is quite relaxing.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 06:17 PM)_

> ... Alright.

_Iris takes a deep breath and closes her eyes. It practically felt like a sauna in the room._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

> Of course, you can leave. I'm just going sit in here and dry off...

_Emmett snorts._

> Maybe take a nap.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

> I'm... I'm okay, I think.

_Iris exhales and tries to make herself comfortable._

> This is fine.

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

_Hector scans the area for either Seth or Emmett._

> Seth was clearly here, but it seems he managed to shoot Sanya a couple times and flee. Look at the markings on her back...

_Hector's finger trails across Sanya's leafy back._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(23-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

_Danny yawns and snaps his fingers demandingly._

> I'm heading to bed, take us to the store, captain.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

> Hmmmmm... Might I speak to the captain soon?

**WatchfulDrake** _(23-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

_Hector leads Denyer to the medbay while pushing the stretcher._

> After I get you fixed up, bud.
