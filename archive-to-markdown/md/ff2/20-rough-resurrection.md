_Iris examines her firey arms with a sort of horrified fascination._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:27 PM)_

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:28 PM)_

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

_Iris starts to rub at a line, and discovers that it won't come off. It's just a part of her skin._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

> No, I was already part of the Queen's personal guard...
> But i failed and shes wondering the cosmos like me. Hopefully she's safe...

_Deyner sighs._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:31 PM)_

> Yeah, she always sent her ambassadors.

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

_Seth scoffs._

> The Royal Navy has better perks anyways.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

_Iris sighs heavily, and looks at the tubes and needles attached to her skin. She doesn't feel as though they're necessary, anymore._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

_Deyner audibly weeps, looking over the rubble of his fallen planet from the confines of his corvette._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

_Emmett sticks Sanya's flower in his ear and leaves the restroom._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

_Emmett is still looking around for the source of the voice, ignorant of the fact that Sanya's flower is still in his ear._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

_`Sanya's Flower`: The flower's voice grows more strained, as if Sanya's life is hanging in the balance and growing more faint by the minute._

_Iris starts to walk towards the kitchen. She hums and eyeballs Emmett._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

_Seth closes in on Emmett, his hands posed to steal the grass from Emmett's mouth._

> Gimme'!

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

_Seth gives a toothy grin._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_Iris flinches, turning a bit. Tears work their way into her eyes and she shuts them quickly, trying to force the tears back._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

> So Hector put her down.... Unfortunately...

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

_Chomsky mumbles to himself._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

_The flower stops wilting and starts to grow._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

_Garrick appears in the greenroom after getting tired of pretending to be a car._

> Heyo.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

t!choose flower grows super fast | takes several turns

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

🤔 | PlasmaPerson, I pick flower grows super fast!

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris know how to operate a tractor beam?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

🎱 | My sources say no, Jelsafan0.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_Chomsky backs up from the growing flower._

> Okay, that's definitely unnatural.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris learn how to use the tractor beam?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, Deyner.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_There is now a very large green thing growing deep in the soil of the greenroom._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_Iris, upon noticing the beacon, scrambles around to find the tractor beam controls. Instead, she finds the manual for the ship!_

> Ah! A manual!

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

_Garrick points a big finger at the plant growing in the soil._

> Woah! There's a very large thing deep in the soil!

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

> Let's see here... and...

_Iris presses a couple buttons and starts up the tractor beam onto Deyner's corvette._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

_Emmett tilts his head and observes the plant growing. He eyeballs the curves forming._

> That thing looks.... Oddly feminine.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

_Chomsky sweats from the strange growth occurring._

> Uh, should we pull it out?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

> Don't.... Don't startle a sleeping lady.

_Emmett peers over to Chomsky._

> Be courteous.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

> Won't she suffocate?

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_Garrick smiles widely at the prospect of killing whatever is growing in the soil._

> Pull it out.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

> No. We'd only hurt her!

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_Garrick shrugs._

> That's fine.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

> Alright...

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_Chomsky, Emmett, and Garrick all hear a faint, gruff voice._

> Can you bring me some clothes?

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick pull it out?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, RPretribution.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

> Um...

_Chomsky covers his eyes and leaves._

> I'll go get some for you.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Emmett gives a sly peek at Sanya and then also heads out the greenroom momentarily._

> Let me.

t!8ball Does Emmett go and grab some clothes from his dresser?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

🎱 | Signs point to yes, Zander.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

_Emmett returns with his trademark red burgundy sweater and sweatpants. He covers his eyes to be respectful when handing the clothes to Sanya._

> I mean, they aren't much, but they're something. Here.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> Can you all leave the room now?

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_Chomsky sits around the doorway and lights a cigarette._

> Gladly.

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> Yeah...

_Garrick backs up through the greenroom wall and meets up with Chomsky._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_Emmett thinks for a moment, tears slowly dripping beneath his hooves. He reluctantly leaves Sanya unattended and hangs out with the others just outside._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

_Sanya gets out of the dirt and tries to get dressed._

t!8ball Do the clothes fit?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

🎱 | Better not tell you now, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

t!8ball does Chomsky join iris to investigate the beacon

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

🎱 | My reply is no, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_With a lit cigarette in his mouth, Chomsky goes back to the kitchen to sit among the muffins._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Garrick joins Iris to investigate the beacon because the universe hates Chomsky._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Iris is trying her hardest to grab the beacon with the ship's tractor beam._

> ... Hey...

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

> Yo'.

_Garrick enter the cockpit with a lollipop, mystery flavor._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

_Chomsky builds a throne out of the muffins and sits in it. He uses a muffin as an ashtray of sorts. After a couple of seconds, he starts sinking in the throne._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 9, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

_Determined, Iris finally grabs ahold of the corvette and starts to pull it towards the ship._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

> Could you not?

_Seth bursts into the cockpit and tries to bump Iris away from the console with his hips._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

_The muffins are so comfy that Chomsky doesn't bother moving._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

_Iris pushes against Seth with her weight._

> Please move!

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

> I gotta do some software and hardware updates that Emmett forgot to do!

_Seth manages to push Iris out of the way and starts messing with the tractor beam._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

t!8ball Does the tractor beam manage to pull Deyner completely in before Seth messes with it too much?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

🎱 | It is certain, Deyner.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

> Fuck off, Seth!

_Iris continues to try and push Seth out of the way to no avail._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

> School jail!

_Garrick takes out a bird cage with the bottom taken out and fits it over Seth's head._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

_Iris laughs._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

_Deyner dreams about becoming a master bounty hunter as the tractor beam takes his corvette._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does the tractor beam break?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, definitely, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

> Oh boy...

_Iris glares at Seth angrily._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

> Look what you did, retard!

_Seth flicks Iris._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Deyner's corvette, upon the tractor beam breaking, causes Deyner to hit the windshield._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

> Don't touch the fucking controls next time.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Iris flips off Seth and heads to the ship airlock._

> Screw off. I'm gonna go help.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Deyner slowly slides across the windshield._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

> The shirt fits, but the pants are a bit small.
> Thanks, Emmett.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Emmett, sitting around the doorway to the greenroom, turns to speak to Sanya._

> Sorry!

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Seth speaks into his comms watch._

> Emmett, get some spare parts for the tractor beam when you're free, Iris broke it while I was doing some updates.

_Seth groans angrily, glaring as Iris leaves._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Garrick, floating outside of the ship, points at Deyner, who is still smushed against the windshield of his corvette._

> Is this guy new? He seems to like windows.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> I'm a little small, as you know...

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Deyner continues to slide for a good amount of time._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> Yeah, I know.

_Sanya tries her hardest to stretch out Emmett's pants. She manages to rip some of the threads out before she quits trying._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Emmett's more focused on Sanya, considering that he's turned off his communications watch._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick notice and do nothing to help Deyner?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, RPretribution.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Deyner continues to slide and is knocked out from the lack of oxygen in his corvette. There's roughly only five percent oxygen left!_

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett peek into the greenroom?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Seth exhales as he doesn't receive a response from Emmett._

> Poo butt.

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

> Eh, he'll be fine.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya leave the greenroom?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

> They're wearable.

_Sanya exits the greenroom and unintentionally hits Emmett's snout with her elbow._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

_Garrick flies out to the other side of the corvette and pushes it with all his might. It only takes a bit of force to move his ship over to the docking port._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

> Ow...

_Emmett holds his snout._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

_Deyner nearly slides off his windshield._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

> But that's good...

_Emmett looks up at Sanya with teary eyes and a curious smile._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

> Oh, sorry...

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

> You're fine...

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner's ship smack into the Panty Slingshot and dock due to airlock stuff?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, PlasmaPerson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

> Ugh...

_Seth heads out to the airlock, not wanting any stowaways to join his crew._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Deyner floats unconsciously in his ship._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Iris walks over to the door, opens the docking bay, and grabs Deyner from his ship._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

> Are you Sanya?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris slap Deyner, waking him up?

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

> Yes.

_Sanya tilts her head, wondering how Emmett would react._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris slap Deyner, waking him up?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

🎱 | Better not tell you now, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Emmett rubs his goat eyes._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

> Wake up! Live!

_Iris shakes Deyner's head._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner wake up and see the stranger?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

🎱 | Signs point to yes, Deyner.

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth airlock the trash compactor, thus airlocking Deyner and Iris?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, Bagelwrecker.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_Deyner wakes up and looks around the airlock room._

> Where am I?

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> I'm not sure how florans do that, but all florans can revive themselves by getting someone re-planting their flower...

_Sanya furrows her brow._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> Who are you?

_Deyner looks into Iris's fiery gaze._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> I'm Iris. You're on the ship.

_Iris helps Deyner stand up and takes him out of the airlock room._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_Garrick re-joins Emmett and Sanya._

> What if someone cuts off your flower?

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> What ship?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_Iris shifts her hair to reveal her pointy elf ears._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_Emmett starts to hug Sanya tightly, relieved she's back from the dead. Tears stream from his eyes._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> I'm just curious. Not like I'd do it...

_Garrick gives a sinister smile._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> But since it's a plant-eat-plant world, no one really plants other people's flowers...

_Sanya sighs and hugs Emmett back._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> I don't know. It's just the ship...

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_`Phonebooth`: The phonebooth in the corvette starts ringing._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Deyner has a puzzled look as he tries to understand what type of elf Iris is._

> You're a elf but you dont look like a drow, or a snow elf?

_Deyner scoffs and speaks with a gruff, venomous voice._

> Or even a high elf?

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_`Phonebooth`: The phonebooth starts ringing louder._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Sanya looks down and is a bit irked from Emmett's lack of pants, given that he was still in his swim trunks._

> Where are your pants?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

_Emmett chuckles and sniffles._

> We went swimming before all of that bullshit went down...

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> High... elf...

_Iris recoils, flashbacks of her discriminatory childhood coming back._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> Oh yeah. I forgot.

_Sanya is starting to get tired of the hugging, especially given how bad Emmett was starting to smell in his piss-stained trunks._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

_Iris composes herself._

> I'm half light elf, half archidemon.

_Iris states harshly, looking down at Deyner._

> And I just saved your life.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> Wait!

_Sanya prods Emmett to stop the hugging._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

_`Phonebooth`: PHONEBOOTH RINGING INTENSIFIES_

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> How's Iris?!

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

_Emmett finally lets go of Sanya._

> Iris is fine.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> I'm sorry if I offended you. I did not mean to...

_Deyner frowns._

> Thank you for saving me.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> I just was concerned for you...

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> .. It's fine...

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> I know. I'm sorry.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> You really mean a lot to me...

_Emmett wipes his eyes._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> The others are that way.

_Iris points towards the greenroom._

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick go into the room with Iris and Deyner?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, RPretribution.

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> I have other things to do.

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> Boring...

_Garrick leaves Sanya and Emmett, not caring that Sanya was just revived._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> Who are the others?

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> You did too.

_Sanya looks beyond Emmett and scans the vicinity for Iris._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> Try finding out.

_Iris flashes out in the direction of the greenroom._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

_Deyners shakes his head._

> Wait... are you really a half-light elf? I thought those people were just from stories?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth get a call from an Elvish stock investor?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

🎱 | It is certain, Zander.

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

> Hey, it's window guy.

_Garrick takes out a squeegee._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

> No. We were real. But now I'm all that's left...

_Iris gives Garrick a glare._

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

> Ummmm...

_Deyner, confused by the tool Garrick is holding, questions him._

> Who are you?

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

_Iris sighs heavily._

> Good luck.

_She keeps to herself, reminded once again of Dread's words._

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya go off to find Iris?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

> I'll be back.

_Sanya pats Emmett's head and leaves him to find Iris._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

_Iris sighs, turns away, and starts to head back to her room. She is truly alone._

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

_Seth groans and answers the phone._

> Hello, this is Seth Im'K'Inki speaking.

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

> Your worst nightmare. But you can call me Garrick.

_Garrick tosses the squeegee away and holds out his hand._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

_Emmett looks down at himself._

> I really should get some pants on...

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

t!8ball Does Chomsky toss a muffin at Deyner in greeting?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

_Emmett sniffs himself and is revolted._

> Rather, I should just take a shower...

_Emmett leaves to go grab some clothes and take a shower._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

> `Stock Broker`: Hello? Is this Seth speaking? I have a deal of a lifetime for you!

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

_Garrick, not at all offended that Deyner did not take his hand, pulls it back._

> Where'd you even come from?
> Besides space.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

_Chomsky, in the living block with all the others, flicks a muffin in Deyner's direction._

> Hey, another person to die in crazy adventures. Cool.

_Chomsky gives an odd frown._

> We have fun.

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

> What do you want? Trying to manage a crew here.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

_Deyner looks away dramatically._

> A place that is no longer...

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

_Sanya enters the hallway to her and Iris's room._

> Iris? Where did you go?

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

_Garrick takes out some pink fuzzy handcuffs._

> Chonky, we should totally enslave this guy. Iris doesn't seem to like him.

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

> T'was destroyed by a madman on a quest for power.

_Deyner is taken aback by Garrick's suggestion of enslaving him._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Emmett grabs a fresh Elven military sweater and some gray sweatpants. The usual._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Iris steps into the doorway of her room, and leans heavily against it, back to the hallway._

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

> `Stock Broker`: What if I told you I could get you 700 million Ducketts just from buying into the Elven Expo stock?!

**Deyner** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Deyner growls at Garrick and pulls his blades._

> You may try. But I am no one's slave.

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Chomsky pulls out his flamethrower. No one is enslaving anyone._

> Wanna' run that name by me again, Garlic?

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Garrick is unfazed by Chomsky and Deyner's threats._

> ... You guys realize I'm incorporeal, right?

**Bagelwrecker** _(23-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

> Yeah, that's a fat chance. You're just trying to scam me, aren't you?

**Brakia** _(23-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

> Iris?

_Sanya looks about the hallway, seemingly unable to find Iris._

**Jelsafan0** _(23-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

_Tears begin to stream down Iris's face as she slides down the wall, to be on the floor._

t!8ball Does Iris begin to sob, curling into fetal position?

**Tatsumaki** _(23-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

🎱 | My sources say no, Jelsafan0.

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

> Chonky. That's your new nickname. What do you think?

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

_Emmett passes by Iris as he heads for the shower._

**PlasmaPerson** _(23-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

_Chomsky grimaces._

> I hate you.

**Zander** _(23-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

_Emmett stops as he finds her on the floor against the wall._

> Iris.

**RPretribution** _(23-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_
