_Ibraxas bolts up._

> I'm up. What did I miss?

**Zander** _(13-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

_Emmett wakes up, still on Maia's back from the night prior. He smiles softly before the ship rumbles erratically, startling him._

> What the hell is happening?

**Bagelwrecker** _(13-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

> There's a cunty pilot flying close to us.

t!8ball Does Seth lean back in the captain's chair?

**Tatsumaki** _(13-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

🎱 | Concentrate and ask again, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(13-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

_Emmett takes a look at the sensors through his watch, groaning._

> These guys seem really aggressive.

**Bagelwrecker** _(13-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

> Probably Space Dust junkies.

**Brakia** _(13-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

> Could they be angry at us?

t!8ball Does Ibraxas get his sniper in preparation for a battle?

**Tatsumaki** _(13-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

_Seth smirks to himself._

**Zander** _(13-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

t!8ball Does Ibraxas, rather, man the ship's turrets?

**Tatsumaki** _(13-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(13-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Seth gets up from his captain's chair._

> You mind piloting, Emmett?

**Brakia** _(13-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

> I'll get the turrets.

_Ibraxas heads over to the turrets, manning the console._

**Zander** _(13-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Emmett sighs, remembering the newscast from earlier._

> Wasn't there something about us owning the Disney Diamond or something?

**Bagelwrecker** _(13-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Seth takes out the diamond and polishes it a bit, smiling into its reflection._

> Oh yeah.

_Seth pockets the diamond._

> Anyways use those maneuvers that I taught you Emmett.

**Zander** _(13-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

> For ship battle?

**Bagelwrecker** _(13-Jul-18 05:34 PM)_

> Yeah.

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:09 PM)_

_Maia wakes up, covered in blankets and... a fairly unclothed Emmett._

> Ugh.. that alcohol put me out. How long was I asleep?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

> Just like 12 hours, no biggie.

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

_Maia looks back at Emmett and smiles softly, having invited him to sleep upon her the night prior._

> Oh my goodness.

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:11 PM)_

_Emmett rubs his eyes, yawning._

> How long was I out?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:11 PM)_

> Maybe a couple hours.
> Those assholes are still on our left flank and they keep getting closer.

_Seth slams a fist on the table nearby._

**Brakia** _(21-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

_Ibraxas looks back at the hall, seeing Maia and Asier walk by._

> Mornin'.

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

> Hey.

_Asier stretches dramamtically._

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

> Oh are we being attacked!?

**Brakia** _(21-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

> I think so.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett hop off of whatever he was sleeping upon?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

🎱 | Ask again later, Zander.

_Jim sits up suddenly._

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> Hello, Emmett.

_Maia pets Emmett's head._

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

> Hey Emmett, you ready to do those maneuvers yet?

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

_Emmett shivers from the touch, his sensitive horns not helping stay composed._

> Uhm... Hey.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

_Seth tries to maneuver the ship, but only gets shocked from the console._

> Those guys are like ten meters from us!

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

_Emmett, more focused on his desires than the situation happening around the ship, speaks softly to Maia._

> This isn't awkward, is it?

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

> No, youre okay.

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

_Jim puts his fists on his hips._

> Fuukin' space pi'rets, am I right?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does Ibraxas check the damage?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, Brakia.

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

_Emmett snaps back to reality, realizing the space pirates are a bit more important._

> I'm going to check what's going on.

_Emmett slips off of Maia's back and puts on some clothing._

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> Has anyone established a proper connection with the other ship?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

_Seth still tries to finagle with the console._

> Space link's down.

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> Your back is mighty comfortable.

_Emmett pats Maia's back before heading to the cockpit._

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

_Asier pops his head into the cockpit._

> Is it hostile?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> We're in deepspace.

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> Thank you!

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

> Well, I would have woken up to something else if they shot.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

> They'll need to get closer to us if they want to initiate contact with us.

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

> I wouldn't mind that.

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

> Show me where the cannons are, we do have defensive cannons on this thing, right?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

> No.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

> This is a residential ship for right now.

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

> Is there any way I can get a shot outside the ship?

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

> We might have a turret or two.

🎱 | My reply is no, Mica.

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

> I might need to strap in.

_Jim walks over to the turrets._

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

_Maia holds her arms out, her attempt at creating a protective bubble only causing a fizz within her fingertips._

> My magic doesnt seem to be working...

**Brakia** _(21-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

_Ibraxas takes out some faulty wiring of the ship's comms systemm and replaces it._

t!8ball Does Jim go and find a space suit?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, TheBlade.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

> The comms are working, just space link doesn't reach this far in space.

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

_Jim puts on a spacesuit._

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> Guys, where's my plasma crossbow?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> We're in deep space.

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett find his crossbow and put on his goggles?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, Zander.

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

_Emmett looks out the window, judging the distance between the two ships with his goggles._

> They're approximately five meters from us.

**Brakia** _(21-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

> Dang. We'll need to put 'Better Space Link' on the wish list.

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

> I think I should go somewhere safe...

_Maia started backing away from the others._

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

_Asier looks annoyed._

> Why don't we already have one of those?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

> We don't go into deep space all that often anyways.

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:24 PM)_

> I think we'll be fine, Maia.

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:24 PM)_

_Jim sits at the hatch._

> Well, I have to get real close if we plan to attack.

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:24 PM)_

> Might need to shoot a warning shot or two.

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:24 PM)_

> Okay... If things get bad, just tell me and I will try my magic again.

_Maia sits down, trying to calm herself._

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:24 PM)_

> We're absolutely safe. You got Emmett, Jim, and I to keep you safe.

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

> Thank you...

_Maia starts to get a bit emotional._

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

> Get the comms up while I get outside, ganna' get a closer look at it.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

t!8ball Does Ibraxas grab his toolkit from his room?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

> Should I space walk out there?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

_Seth, without even thinking, immediately interjected, trying to be contrarian despite Emmett's knowledge of ships._

> No it's red.

**Brakia** _(21-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

_With his toolbox in hand, Ibraxas heads towards the engine room._

> I'll be right back. I need to grab something.

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

> Is there anything you need me to do?

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

_Asier clearly wasn't paying attention, given that Jim was already at the airlock._

> Who's going with me?

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

_The other ship aims its weapons and starts to shoot wildly at the crew's ship._

> They're hostile!

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

> Oh!

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Maia covers her face with her hands and wings._

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Seth starts to push Emmett towards the cockpit._

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

> Let me get over there.

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Jim exits the airlock and walks outside of the ship_

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

_Asier exits with Jim._

t!8ball Does Emmett do Evasive Maneuver 21?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

t!8ball Does the green cable keep Jim safe?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

_Jim Flies a few feet into space._

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

_Emmett angrily glares at Seth, who usually didn't care about anyone else in the crew._

> Are you fucking drunk, Seth?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

_Seth laughs heartily._

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

_Jim tugs on his tether incessantly._

> Pull me back, PULL ME BACK!

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:34 PM)_

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:34 PM)_

_Emmett looks back, slightly in a panic._

> Do we have any turrets?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:34 PM)_

> We probably do.

**Brakia** _(21-Jul-18 05:34 PM)_

_Ibraxas rolls his eyes and mutters sarcastically._

**RPretribution** _(21-Jul-18 05:34 PM)_

_Garrick finally joins the fray._

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:34 PM)_

> We're getting attacked by pirates.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:35 PM)_

_Seth points to a button on the main console._

> Click the red button with the laser rifle on it.

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:35 PM)_

_Jim shakes his head and changes his mind about wanting to head back to the ship. He points at the pirates' ship._

> We need to get on board that ship, Asier.

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 05:35 PM)_

_Asier's at the crew's ship airlock, scratching at the door like a cat._

> Please open the airlock, I want back in!
> I'm scared!

**Brakia** _(21-Jul-18 05:35 PM)_

_Ibraxas is inspecting most the ship's defenses, seeing how they are definitely not maintained._

> Our cannons are close to unusable. We haven't repaired them yet.

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:35 PM)_

> No, get back here, I'm not going in alone.

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 05:35 PM)_

_Asier reluctantly flies back to Jim._

> Fine. I'll use my swords to cut inside...

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:35 PM)_

_Maia is shivering in the cockpit, having moved there to be with Seth and Emmett._

> I'm scared..

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 05:36 PM)_

> Or the door.

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:36 PM)_

_Emmett holds out his hoof._

> Maia, hold my hoof.

**RPretribution** _(21-Jul-18 05:36 PM)_

_Garrick, mistaking fiction for reality, believes that Maia holding Emmett's hoof would cause some catastrophic event._

> Don't do that!

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:36 PM)_

_Jim and Aiser look for a way into the pirates' ship._

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:36 PM)_

_Maia holds his cloven hoof with her soft human hand._

**RPretribution** _(21-Jul-18 05:36 PM)_

> Can't we just let them in?
> We don't need to breathe.

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:37 PM)_

_Jim tries to speak louder into his watch by bringing it closer to his face despite being in a spacesuit._

> May I remind you, most of us NEED OX-E-GEN!

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:37 PM)_

> Garrick, I have a feeling that you don't know about me.
> Or Seth.

**RPretribution** _(21-Jul-18 05:37 PM)_

_Garick puts a hand to his face in thought and looks back at Emmett._

> Good point.

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:37 PM)_

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:41 PM)_

_The pirates start to take shots at Jim, having found him._

_Jim attempts to dodge, kicking himself off the side of the pirate ship._

> FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK ME!

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 05:41 PM)_

> Hey Emmett, remember that cool thing I taught you?

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 05:41 PM)_

_Emmett pinches his snout in annoyance at Jim getting caught._

**Mica** _(21-Jul-18 05:41 PM)_

t!8ball Does Maia randomly start crying purple sparkly streams of tears?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jul-18 05:41 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, Mica.

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 05:41 PM)_

_Jim attempts to get back to the pirate ship amidst the gunfire._

> Well, we now know where the door is!

**RPretribution** _(21-Jul-18 05:42 PM)_

_Garrick takes out a toy spaceship from his pocket and plays with it, flying it around with his hand._

> Space is scary and spooky.

_Lodas coughs._

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 06:27 PM)_

_Asier is now being petty, pointing at some random robots on the ship._

> The robot dogs...

**Brakia** _(21-Jul-18 06:27 PM)_

> No, he shot the only other person.

**RPretribution** _(21-Jul-18 06:27 PM)_

_Asier crouches down to the marble._

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 06:28 PM)_

_Emmett browses for whatever "emperor" Lodas was talking about._

> This emperor he's talking about is from a video game.

**RPretribution** _(21-Jul-18 06:28 PM)_

**Brakia** _(21-Jul-18 06:28 PM)_

_Ibraxas tilts his head in confusion._

**Mr.WobblyShark** _(21-Jul-18 06:29 PM)_

_Mmarble Lodas grows a mouth, slowly reverting back._

_Lodas attempts to make a pokerface again._

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 06:29 PM)_

_Asier wasn't that surprised from Lodas's sudden marblization, having experienced others being marblized in the past._

> Uh-oh, who used the sacred magic of marbles?

**Brakia** _(21-Jul-18 06:29 PM)_

> What happened?

_Ibraxas inspects the marble to the best of his ability._

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 06:29 PM)_

> Did I just kick him into the next dimension?

**Brakia** _(21-Jul-18 06:29 PM)_

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 06:29 PM)_

_Emmett leaves the cockpit and decides to get something to drink to calm his nerves._

> Why does everything need to turn into marbles?

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 06:29 PM)_

_Asier shakes his head after thinking for more than one second._

> Probably not, but still.

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 06:29 PM)_

_Emmett takes out a bottle of beer and takes a couple of large sips._

> Actually, screw it.

_Emmett leaves for the airlock._

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 06:30 PM)_

_Jimm takes the marblized Lodas._

> I'll bring it back... I guess...

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 06:30 PM)_

> Back to the ship!

_Asier marches back._

**Brakia** _(21-Jul-18 06:30 PM)_

_Ibraxas stays, his worldview shattered due to the marble._

**RPretribution** _(21-Jul-18 06:30 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 06:30 PM)_

> Put it in a box.

**Brakia** _(21-Jul-18 06:31 PM)_

_Garrick "shrugs"._

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 06:31 PM)_

_Emmett looks over the wreckage the crew caused, and the number of bodies. He frowns, given that the "pirates" were mostly innocent._

_Garrick wiggles his fingers and licks his lips feverishly._

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 06:31 PM)_

> Can anyone figure out what the hell is on with this marble?

_Jim holds out the marble, of which is making angry frowns._

> And does anyone know where I can get a good eye around here?

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 06:33 PM)_

_Garrick's wiggling fingers near closer to the dog intensely._

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jul-18 06:33 PM)_

_Seth has a traumatic flashback of Belly Button Dog._

**RPretribution** _(21-Jul-18 06:33 PM)_

_Garrick is about to grab the dog._

**PlasmaPerson** _(21-Jul-18 06:33 PM)_

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 06:34 PM)_

> Wait, where is that dog from?

_Jim is trying to remember a certain baby-eating robo-dog._

**Zander** _(21-Jul-18 06:36 PM)_

_Emmett scoffs, considering that Maia would probably not like a horse on the ship._

> Not a horse.

**RPretribution** _(21-Jul-18 06:36 PM)_

_Garrick turns to Emmett, pretending to pout._

> Why not?

**TheBlade** _(21-Jul-18 06:44 PM)_
