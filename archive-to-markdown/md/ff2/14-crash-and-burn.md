_Sanya quieted down, trying to think of the right words to say._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:15 PM)_

> With lots of plants..

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:16 PM)_

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:16 PM)_

_KYL300 disconnects from its charging station._

_Emmett flickers his tongue out in boredom._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:16 PM)_

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:17 PM)_

> Do we have any leftover grass?

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:17 PM)_

> Can we just go somewhere with nothing but plants... and maybe some good sights...

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:17 PM)_

> I haven't had some in a few days...

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:17 PM)_

_Jim shrugs._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:18 PM)_

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:19 PM)_

_Emmett weakly smacks his face in frustration._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:19 PM)_

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:19 PM)_

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:19 PM)_

t!8ball Are all the women alive?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:21 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:21 PM)_

_Some of the womens' heads move a bit mechanically, falling limp._

> They don't look so well...

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:22 PM)_

> That's cause' some of them are robots.

_Seth flicks one of the robots' faces._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:23 PM)_

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:23 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:23 PM)_

> They're servant bots...

_Seth stares at his son, frowning for just a second at his demeanor._

> Go check under my bed Emmett.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:23 PM)_

> They sometimes enslave other species to pleasure themselves sexually...

_Despite speaking in a factual tone, the KYL unit appears to have a judgmental stance, its hands on its hips._

_Emmett eyeballs Sanya, his head upside down from the couch arm._

> Plant person--er, Sanya. Do you happen to grow grass on you?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:25 PM)_

_Chomsky nods as he enters the lounge._

> Yo'.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:25 PM)_

> Hey.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:25 PM)_

_Chomsky points finger guns at KYL300._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:26 PM)_

> No, I don't grow grasss on myssself.

_Emmett sighs._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:26 PM)_

> Exactly, because grass doesn't grow on grass!

_Chomsky winks._

> Heh.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:27 PM)_

_Emmett groans from Chomsky's comment._

> Shut up, pyro.

_Emmett slowly gets up from the sofa, heading to Seth's room._

> I'll be in Seth's room, if you need me.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:27 PM)_

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:31 PM)_

> Good idea.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:31 PM)_

_Emmett was cautiously digging under Seth's bed, trying to find some grass._

> MMh mhmh mhmhh m mmh!

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:31 PM)_

> Broke? what did you wassste all your money on?

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:31 PM)_

> My guess is food and hookers.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:31 PM)_

> Food, fuel, ammo, repairs, and hookers.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:33 PM)_

_Emmett feels something slimy on his hoof and jumps in surprise, his horns hitting the bottom of the bed._

> Fuck!

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:33 PM)_

> Would you like me to search for any jobs in the area?

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:33 PM)_

_Emmett groans and shakes his hoof furiously._

> I got condom on my hands!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:33 PM)_

> I wouldn't mind it.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:33 PM)_

> We could always rob a place...

_Chomsky snickers._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:33 PM)_

_Seth folds his arms in disapproval._

> We could always not.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does Kyle search for jobs in the area?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:34 PM)_

🎱 | My reply is no, ProfessorTree.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:34 PM)_

> We have too many tickets already, no need to bring more attention to that.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:34 PM)_

_Emmett throws a bunch of Seth's stuff out from beneath the bed in a panic._

> THERE'S NO GRASS!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:34 PM)_

> Uh oh...

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:35 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett sluggishly get back to the lounge?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:35 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, definitely, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:35 PM)_

> Guys, lets just find a green planet.
> With grass.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:35 PM)_

> Would I have to leave my flamethrower on the ship?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:35 PM)_

> Depends on where we go.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:36 PM)_

_Emmett falls face first onto the couch. He speaks, his voice muffled._

> Seth, I need you to drive.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:36 PM)_

> Unless you go by a small forest.... JUST A SMALL ONE!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:36 PM)_

> I gotcha.

_Without question, Seth heads to the cockpit, grabbing another box labelled, "ONE-TIME HACK"._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:36 PM)_

> You will have to leave it.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:36 PM)_

> I see. Hm. Too bad.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:37 PM)_

_Sanya gives Jim and Chomsky a disgusted expression._

> If you're dissscusssing dessstroying a foressst, I'm not okay with that.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:37 PM)_

_Emmett groans._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:37 PM)_

> It's not like it's your forest...

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:37 PM)_

_Sanya balls up her fists._

> ALL flora mattersss to me!

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:37 PM)_

_Emmett refuses to raise his head, his voice still muffled._

> Chomps got a point...

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:37 PM)_

_Sanya tilts her head in confusion._

> Chompsss?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:38 PM)_

_Chomsky furrows his brow._

> Who you calling Chomps?

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:38 PM)_

_Emmett relaxes his shoulders._

> I don't think I have the strength to tell you.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:38 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya sit on the couch, eating a clump of raw meat?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:38 PM)_

🎱 | It is certain, Brakia.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:38 PM)_

_Sanya sits on the couch, managing to forget about Emmett. She sits on Emmett's back, who just depresses beneath her body._

> Lets just get there and find out, ok?

_Jim looks around in concern._

> Also, has anyone seen my Guinea Pig?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:39 PM)_

_Chomsky recalls seeing bones in the kitchen trash at one point in time._

> Sanya ate it...

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:39 PM)_

> What?!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:39 PM)_

_Chomsky shrugs apathetically._

> Whoops.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:39 PM)_

_Seth yells from across the ship._

> You mean Lotus?

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:39 PM)_

> Sanya?! WHAT DID YOU DO?!

_Jim's hands shake as he tries to grab Sanya, who manages to dodge him._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:39 PM)_

> That was a guinea pig? Why was it in the fridge?

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:39 PM)_

> Oh...

_Jim puts his hands down and sighs in relief._

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:39 PM)_

_KYL walks over to Seth, ignoring Jim and Sanya's predicament._

> We should get to a flora-filled planet...

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:40 PM)_

> Ok, not the guinea pig then.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:40 PM)_

_Emmett feels Sanya's weight shift, causing him to feel some discomfort._

> If you're going to sit on me, at least sit near my legs...

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:40 PM)_

_Garrick emerges, hearing Emmett's pleas and taking them the wrong way._

> What?!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:40 PM)_

_Chomsky puts a hand on Jim's shoulder._

> Did you check the engine room? Its warm in there.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:40 PM)_

> What?

_Jim makes an absurd look over to Chomsky._

> For Thelma?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:41 PM)_

> Yes.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:41 PM)_

> I could probably scan from here...

_KYL300 sets up its scanning module and looks about the ship for Thelma._

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:41 PM)_

_Garrick ignores Emmett and involves himself in Jim's plight._

> What's Thelma?

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:42 PM)_

> My guinea pig...

_Jim frowns._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:42 PM)_

t!8ball Is Themla found in the scorching hot engine room?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:42 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, PlasmaPerson.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:42 PM)_

_KYL finishes his scanning and gives Jim a thumbs up._

> OH JESUS CHRIST, SHE'S IN THE ENGINE ROOM, ISN'T SHE?!

_Jim runs to the engine room in terror._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:42 PM)_

> I hear little screaming!

_Chomsky follows Jim._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:42 PM)_

_Seth speaks into his comms watch._

> We need heatsinks in the engine room I guess...

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:42 PM)_

> I hear everything!

_Garrick phases into the engine room._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:42 PM)_

> GET HER OUT OF THERE!!

_Jim tries to rescue his pet but upon entering the room, he jumps back, the temperature scorching hot as Seth pilots the ship._

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:42 PM)_

> It seems like it's on fire!

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:42 PM)_

> Woah, really?!

_Garrick circles a finger on the side of his head, signifying that KYL300 is Captain Obvious._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:42 PM)_

> I don't think ssshe'sss gonna sssurvive...

_Sanya looks over from the couch, watching smoke erupt from the engine room._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:42 PM)_

_Chomsky watches Jim try to enter the room._

> She's your rodent...

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:42 PM)_

> It'll be fine.

_Garrick pokes the burning Themla._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:43 PM)_

> Chomsky, you have fireproof clothes, right?!

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:43 PM)_

> If ssshe doesssn't, Can I ea-

_The others look at Sanya disapprovingly._

> Keep her?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:43 PM)_

_Chomsky glares at Sanya._

> Yeah. I do.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:43 PM)_

> GET THE FUCK IN THERE!
> AND GET HER OUT!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:43 PM)_

> Fine.

_Chomsky scoffs and enters the engine room to grab the guinea pig._

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:43 PM)_

> Okay, but...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 01:43 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matthias stare at his hand and view a brand?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:43 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, Enchantingtable2013.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:43 PM)_

_Emmett is still muffled, and nearly pukes._

> Barf.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:43 PM)_

_Jim faces Garrick in disapproval._

> Garrick, they are tinder and are soft at the same time...

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:43 PM)_

_Chomsky grabs the burning rodent with his fireproof gloves. He heads back to Jim and hands her Themla._

> Here you go.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 01:43 PM)_

_Matthias flips his hand repeatedly, in awe of the brand._

> Woah...

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:44 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth pilot the ship to a primitive forest planet?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:44 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, Bagelwrecker.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:44 PM)_

_The rodent stops moving, still engulfed in flames._

> She's a little burnt.

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:44 PM)_

> It's on fire, Chonky!

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:44 PM)_

_Sanya breathes in the fumes, enjoying the smell of smoked meat._

> Yeah, I think sshe'ss dead...

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:44 PM)_

_Jim's mouth quivers. He doesn't care that his hands are burning from holding his dearly departed pet._

> Oh my god, Themla...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 01:44 PM)_

> This thing is kinda cool, especially when it glows...

_Matthias makes a fist, the brand glowing even brighter._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:44 PM)_

t!8ball Is Thelma alive?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:44 PM)_

🎱 | My sources say no, TheBlade.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:44 PM)_

_Chomsky smothers the flames on Thelma, her body lifeless and scorched._

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:44 PM)_

_Emmett squirms beneath Sanya, his weakened body in no state to push her off of him._

> Sanya, get your plant butt off of me.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:44 PM)_

_Jim falls to his knees dramatically, screaming to the roof while holding the rodent corpse._

> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:44 PM)_

_Garrick, again, takes note of Emmett's pleas._

> Woah. What's going on between you two?

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:45 PM)_

> WHY CRUEL WORLD!?!

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:45 PM)_

> Yeah, ssshe'ss dead. Can I sssee her?

_Sanya holds her hands out for Themla's body, not bothering to stand up._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:45 PM)_

> It's okay, that's how you deal with a living being in fire.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:45 PM)_

_Emmett tries to pick himmself up to no avail._

> You are extremely heavy for a plant!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:45 PM)_

> She'll be fine...

_Chomsky stares at Themla's body apathetically._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 01:45 PM)_

> I wonder what such a cool tattoo can do...

_Matthias gets up, still staring at his branded hand._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:45 PM)_

_Jim shakes with rage at Sanya's euphemisms for eating his pet._

> Sanya, I will personaly throw you back in that cell if you touch her.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:45 PM)_

_Sanya leans back fromm Jim's threat._

> What?

_Sanya finally notices Emmett underneath her. She is mortified by using Emmett as a chair._

> OH MY GOD!

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:45 PM)_

> How heavy are plant people normally...?

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:45 PM)_

_Jim grumbles._

> About 147 pounds.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:46 PM)_

t!choose a primitive forest planet | a high-tech forest planet | a war planet cloaked as a forest planet

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:46 PM)_

🤔 | ProfessorTree, I pick a war planet cloaked as a forest planet!

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:46 PM)_

_Garrick, surprised by how heavy a plant could be, squeals._

> E!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:46 PM)_

> Alright, we're going logging.

_Seth redirects the ship to head to the aforementioned war planet cloaked as a forest planet._

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:46 PM)_

> I give up...

_Emmett stops squirming and sighs loudly._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:46 PM)_

_Sanya gasps at the prospect of chopping wood on a potentially untouched planet._

> We better not be!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:47 PM)_

_Jim pinches his brow._

> How about, no touching the plants, we go bury Themla, and Emmett gets some grass?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:47 PM)_

> Spread the ashes...

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:47 PM)_

_Jim eyeballs the cockpit._

> No touching the plants, especially for you, Seth.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:47 PM)_

> Nah, I got a better idea...

_Seth smirks._

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:47 PM)_

_Garrick takes out a rubber mallet from his pockets and makes a swinging motion, confusing the mallet for an axe._

> You can't stop me!

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:47 PM)_

_Sanya shifts her weight intentionally to be annoying._

> Get the ass off of me!!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:47 PM)_

> In all ways, Seth!
> No touching!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:48 PM)_

_Sanya pets Emmett's head to his chagrin._

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:48 PM)_

> Oh.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:48 PM)_

_Seth laughs ferociously._

> That's a fetish in Emmett's culture.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:48 PM)_

_Emmett holds his face, having been reminded by some forms of Squoatopian media Seth shown him in the past._

> This is embarrassing...

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:48 PM)_

_Sanya looks at Emmett in mild disgust._

> I did not know that.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:48 PM)_

_KYL300 tilts its head._

> Is the crew always this dysfunctional?

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:48 PM)_

> I'll get off...

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:48 PM)_

_Jim cringes._

> That's a fetish in many cultures..

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:49 PM)_

_Garrick turns to Kyle._

> Yeah.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:49 PM)_

_Chomsky shrugs, taking off his gloves._

> I dunno. I've only been here a week, but so far yeah.

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:49 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya get off of Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:49 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook not so good, RPretribution.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:49 PM)_

_Emmett mumbles, defeated._

> Just move to my legs please...

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:50 PM)_

> Alright.

_Sanya, instead of getting off of Emmett like she said she would, stays in place._

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:50 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew reach the planet?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:50 PM)_

🎱 | It is certain, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:50 PM)_

_As the ship enters the atmosphere, Jim stares the ship's sensors, irked by how peaceful forest is._

> Something doesn't seem right...

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:50 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya get off Emmett yet?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:50 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, Brakia.

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:51 PM)_

> Well, you guys can stay here.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:51 PM)_

_Emmett, still weakened by his grass withdrawals, is starting to get pissed by Sanya's humor._

> Move to my flipping legs, woman!

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:51 PM)_

> Have fun.

_Garrick heads away from the couch duo._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:51 PM)_

_Jim stares out a window, looking about the forest's flora below with his cybernetic eye._

> These plants are not habitable together... at least, not that close to each other.
> Something doesn't seem right.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:51 PM)_

> Something's off...

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:51 PM)_

_Seth stomps over to Sanya and Emmett and screams at the two of them, tired of their antics._

> JUST FUCK ALREADY!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:51 PM)_

> If it's wrong, burn it down.

_Chomsky smiles like a giddy child by this thought._

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:51 PM)_

_Emmett sighs, not caring about the plants' relationship to one another._

> JIM, I NEED MY GRASS!

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:51 PM)_

_Garrick makes a disgusted face over what he was hearing._

> Oh.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:52 PM)_

> We need to leave. NOW.

_KYL heads over to the cockpit in a panic._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:52 PM)_

_Seth flings his arms forward with each word._

> JUST EAT HER ASS!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:52 PM)_

> Just get out of the ship, we've landed.

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:52 PM)_

> Something's off, and it's not Sanya.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:52 PM)_

_Emmett looks over his shoulder up at Sanya and questions softly._

> Is her ass made of grass?

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:52 PM)_

_Sanya's face contorts in a fury over Seth's demands._

> COULD YOU SSSHUT UP, SSSETH!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:52 PM)_

_Jim takes one look at Seth and rolls his eyes._

> I think, the only thing ON is Seth.

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:52 PM)_

_Garrick giggles._

> Eat Sanya grass!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:52 PM)_

> Not yet...

_Seth winks._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:52 PM)_

_Sanya lightly pushes Emmett's head down._

> Don't touch my butt.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:52 PM)_

_KYL checks the ships sensors and compares it with an air quality scanner._

> This atmosphere is much too polluted to hold this much plant life...

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:52 PM)_

> Eat Sanya!

_Garrick takes out a plastic utensil set._

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:53 PM)_

> We need to get out of here...

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:53 PM)_

> Mmmm, no thanks.

_Seth heads to the ship's entrance with confidence._

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:53 PM)_

> SANYA SALAD!

_Garrick edges closer to Sanya, licking his lips._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:53 PM)_

> Lets press forward!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:53 PM)_

> Sanya isnt even edible, in any way. Most of her is actually poisons.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:53 PM)_

> SHUT UP GARLIC!

_Sanya smacks the plastic spork and knife from Garrick's hands._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:53 PM)_

> For glory and my cock!

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:53 PM)_

_Emmett has completely given up at this point._

> Let me flip over, at least!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:53 PM)_

> Land the ship already! I wanna see what's going on.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:53 PM)_

> Seth, this planet isn't what it seems...

_Kyle sounds nervous._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:53 PM)_

> Fine!

_Sanya gets up to allow Emmett to flip over. He does so while taking a deep breath. Sanya decides to sit back down on him, actually finding her spot comfortable at this point._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:53 PM)_

> I'M GOING TO LOG AND YOU CANT STOP ME!

_Seth grabs an axe from the array of tools mmounted on the wall near the hatch._

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:53 PM)_

> How is Emmett even breathing...?

_Garrick watches as Emmett manages to breath normally despite his chest being depressed._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 01:54 PM)_

t!8ball Does everyone inn the ship get out to investigate the strange planet?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:55 PM)_

🎱 | Don't count on it, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:56 PM)_

_Emmett takes in Garrick's statement and thinks for a moment, questioning how he is able to breathe so well despite the floran's weight._

> Are you like excreting oxygen or something?

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 01:56 PM)_

> Me? I don't know.

_Sanya shrugs._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 01:56 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew land and exit the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:56 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, Bagelwrecker.

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:56 PM)_

> We'll never get anywhere this way...

_Garrick maintains his interest in the plant and her goat seat._

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:57 PM)_

_Emmett looks away, trying to find some good in the world through his fragile state._

> That's kinda cool, if you are...

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:57 PM)_

> We need to get away from this planet, Seth.

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:57 PM)_

_Garrick rolls his eyes, getting a bit irritated by Kyle repeating itself._

> Then let's go, what're we waiting for?

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:58 PM)_

_Kyle decides to go against the captain of the ship, sitting in the pilot's seat to drag the crew away from the potentially dangerous planet._

> Seth, I'm taking the wheel.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 01:59 PM)_

_Jim frowns, having wanted to explore the dangerous forest._

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 01:59 PM)_

_Emmett looks uncomfortable._

> I think you're more bearable now. I guess.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 01:59 PM)_

t!8ball Does Kyle successfully pilot the ship away from the planet?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 01:59 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook not so good, ProfessorTree.

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 01:59 PM)_

_Garrick attempts to push KYL300 out of the pilot's seat despite having no piloting prowess._

> I'll pilot the ship.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:00 PM)_

_Seth, having followed Kyle, actually shoves him out of the seat._

> Fuck off, bastard.

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:00 PM)_

_Garrick grins wildly._

> It'll be fine!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:00 PM)_

> Why are we going away from the planet?!

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:00 PM)_

> I'm great at piloting!

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:00 PM)_

_Kyle gets up, unfazed by Seth's aggressiveness._

> This planet is unsafe.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:00 PM)_

> Who cares!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:00 PM)_

t!8ball Does an unidentified ship start coming towards the crew's location?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:00 PM)_

🎱 | It is certain, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:00 PM)_

> Guys...

_Jim points at a ship heading towards them in the distance._

> What is that?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:01 PM)_

_Seth, Kyle, and Garrick head back out the Polonot._

> It's a ship.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:01 PM)_

> I'll scan it.

_KYL300 starts to get a scan on the ship and is left speechless for a moment._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:02 PM)_

> How about we just ignore it instead?

_Seth takes out his axe and flips it around haphazardly._

> Because I don't care.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:02 PM)_

_Kyle stops scanning the ship._

> Oh, fuck!

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:02 PM)_

> Sanya, could you pass me that bottle over there?

_Emmett points at a bottle of space rum on the endtable._

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:02 PM)_

> That's a Mantis warlord dropship.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:02 PM)_

> Uh, Sssure.

_Sanya, having taken out a book to read, hands Emmett his drink._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:02 PM)_

> Mmmmm... Mantis.

_Seth smiles brightly._

> Been a while since I had mantis stew.

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:03 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick fly around aimlessly?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:03 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, RPretribution.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:03 PM)_

> Manti are some of the most dangerous races known...

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:03 PM)_

_Chomsky clearly does not take the hint, having never heard of the Manti._

> Mantis warlord?

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:03 PM)_

> We need to get the hell out of here!

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:03 PM)_

_Garrick stops flying around aimlessly._

> Then let's go.
> Jeez.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:03 PM)_

_Seth groans and heads further out into the forest._

> They're also the tastiest.
> And I'm hungry.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:03 PM)_

_Chomsky, liking Seth's tone, takes out his flamemthrower psychotically._

> They sound BURNABLE!

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:03 PM)_

_As if controlled by peer pressure, Garrick freezes and digs in his pockets excitedly._

> Ah. Now I'm interested!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:03 PM)_

_Seth starts to chop at a tree, not taking the threat seriously._

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:03 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett start chugging down the space rum Sanya passed him?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:03 PM)_

🎱 | Reply hazy try again,

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:04 PM)_

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett start chugging down the space rum Sanya passed him?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:04 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, Zander.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:04 PM)_

_Emmett takes a swig of the rum, the effects of the alcohol helping him block out the pains from his lack of grass consumption._

> Whooh yeah.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:04 PM)_

_Sanya peers at Emmett from her book._

> Are you getting drunk?

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:04 PM)_

> Warlord dropships often carry at least 200 soldiers...

_The KYL unit's lights change to yellow, expressing a hint of fear._

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:04 PM)_

_Emmett shrugs, continuing to drink._

> I don't think so.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:05 PM)_

_Jim, trying to ignore the Mantis presence on the planet, decides to compare his augments to KYL300._

> So, Kyle, do you even have any heat sensors?

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:05 PM)_

> Takes me a few drinks of this to get me even tipsy...

_Emmett winks at Sanya._

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:05 PM)_

> I do, but the ship is too far away to properly scan it...

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:05 PM)_

_Jim sighs and pauses for a couple of seconds in thought._

> Okay, we will wait then.
> They would have sent something else if they wanted to kill us.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:06 PM)_

> Want some, Sanya?

_Emmett shakes his drink at her._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:06 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya get up and sit in another chair?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:06 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, Brakia.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:06 PM)_

_Sanya rolls her eyes and finally gets off of Emmett, moving to another chair._

> Oof.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:06 PM)_

> I don't think they know we're here. But they will.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:06 PM)_

> The world feels lighter now.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:06 PM)_

> They are coming in our direction...

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:06 PM)_

t!8ball Does the Mantis ship start violently shooting at the crew with spud guns?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:06 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, PlasmaPerson.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:06 PM)_

> And if this is a military place, then they would have high security...

_Jim dodges a potato, it splatting on the ground at a high velocity._

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

> Are those potatoes?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

> AWESOME, FREE FOOD!

_Seth attempts to catch a potato, running about._

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

> I still feel deflated though...

_Emmett starts to shiver, his muscles starting to tense up._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matthias slow his heart rate to 1 BPM?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, Enchantingtable2013.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

_Sanya doesn't pay Emmett any attention, more focused on her book._

> I wonder what'sss happening outssside?

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

_Garrick manages to catch a potato, it having been shot at the correct angle to enter his pocket._

> Baked potatoes???

_Garrick flies about the field, grabbing scraps of potatoes and pocketing them._

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

> Potatoes are a main explosive in the Mantis arsenal...

_KYL300 surprisingly doesn't move, not perceiving the potato storm as a threat just yet._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

_Chomsky dodge rolls away from the onslaught of potatoes._

> SPUDS!

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

_Emmett shudders and grimaces, the veins in his arms starting to pop out._

> I might actually be turning now...

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth shoot the warship and make it crash on a small baby?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

🎱 | My reply is no, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

> Emmett, you might want to come out here, we got a situation.
> And we also have some grass.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:08 PM)_

_Emmett manages to bring his arm to his mouth, the strain in his voice apparent._

> Who the FUCK are you talking to!?

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:08 PM)_

> They're dropping in soldiers!

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

t!choose KYL300 grabs everyone and run to the ship | KYL300 runs to the ship | KYL300 stands its ground

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

🤔 | ProfessorTree, I pick run to the ship!

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

_KYL300 runs back to the ship in a panic._

> I'm going back to the ship! I suggest you follow me!

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

_Garrick flips the ships off._

> HEY! MANTIS! PISS OFF!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

_Jim swerves around and watches the coward robot run off._

> Hey, where do you're think you're going?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

t!8ball Have the Manti ships dropped soldiers?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

🎱 | Don't count on it, Bagelwrecker.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

_Chomsky scoffs._

> Thanks a lot, coward!

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

_Sanya puts down her book as KYL300 enters the room._

> Oh, It'sss the robot...

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

_Garrick smirks and hits his hands in satisfaction._

> They'll go away now.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

_Emmett mutters into his comms, considering that the others are more focused on the Mantis ships._

> It's called "The Crave", by Seth...

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

> I guarantee it.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:10 PM)_

> I need like, some grassy sustainance...

_Emmett watches his other arm waver with more intensity._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:10 PM)_

> More potatoes!

_Seth grabs what he thinks is clean and sticks it into his mouth. He rubs his stomach in satisfaction._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:10 PM)_

> I am standing here, there is no point in running.

_Jim shrugs, not even bothering to dodge the spud rain._

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:10 PM)_

> Hundreds of soldiers are coming our way. We need to get out of here.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:10 PM)_

> At least like ten pounds a semester...

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:10 PM)_

> That'sss alot of grasss.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:11 PM)_

_Matthias walks into the lounge, unaware of the havoc occurring on the planet outside._

> Hey guys, look at this cool tattoo that came out of nowhere!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:11 PM)_

> What?

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:11 PM)_

_Sanya's head bolts towards Matthias as he enters._

> Who the hell are you?

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:11 PM)_

_Emmett inhales, trying not to have an aneursym by Matthias's indifference._

> I am literally dying here and you care about a tattoo, Math.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:11 PM)_

> I'm the real OG, but I've been lowkey.

_Matthias snaps his fingers in Emmett's direction with a beaky smile._

> Yep.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

_Jim yells into the ship from the hatch._

> Hey, Kyle, go turn yourself into a lawn mower or something!

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

_Sanya tilts her head at Matthias in confusion by his slang._

> What doesss that even mean?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

_Matthias puts his hands on his hips and puffs his chest out._

> Ah, you uncultured swine.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

> Excuse me?

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

_Jim is outside the ship, waiting for the arrival of the Mantis ship._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

> The most hip of avians know the code.

_Matthias gyrates his hips._

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:13 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett fall off the couch and attempt to get himself up?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:13 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:13 PM)_

_Jim takes out a cigarette and lights it with a lighter._

> Lawnmowers are probably the worst thing we can call lawn mowers...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:13 PM)_

_Upon Emmett falling, Matthias tenses his eyes, staring at the poor goat._

> Why don't we just drag him out to the grass?

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:13 PM)_

_Emmett pushes himself up in an attempt to get up, but at this point, he's a bit to weak to do even this._

> Is there anything outside?

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:14 PM)_

t!8ball Does the Mantis ship land?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:14 PM)_

🎱 | Ask again later, TheBlade.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:14 PM)_

> There's a warlord dropship outside...

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:14 PM)_

_Chomsky smiles, his sunglasses reflecting the light directly back at the ship attacking them._

> Just carnage.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:14 PM)_

> Uh oh.

_Matthias frowns._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:14 PM)_

t!8ball Does the Mantis ship land?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:14 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook not so good, TheBlade.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:14 PM)_

> The Mantis are coming. Seth thinks it'll be a good idea to try and fight.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:15 PM)_

> Cause I'm hungry, robo-bro!

_With one final chop, Seth's finally able to chop down a tree, it making a huge thump outside._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:15 PM)_

_Matthias jumps from the thump of the tree startling him._

> I just got out of a mid-sleep journey to find my creator and there's already people dying?
> What a vacation.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:15 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya leave the ship to see what's happening?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:15 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook not so good, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:16 PM)_

_Sanya frets over Emmett's condition._

> You okay, Emmett?

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:16 PM)_

_Cigarette in mouth, Jim takes out his shotgun, readying it._

> Everyone get out here, we are about to get some visitors!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:17 PM)_

> Yes, he is.

_Matthias prods Emmett with the talons on his leg._

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:17 PM)_

_Emmett swipes at Matthias's foot weakly._

> I think I'm in a shitty position...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:17 PM)_

> Totally not malnourished.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:17 PM)_

_Sanya is anxious, her brow raising in worry._

> What do you mean?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:19 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett start saying nonsense and hallucinates due to his condition?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:19 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, PlasmaPerson.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:20 PM)_

_Matthias shakes his head and shifts his focus to the glowing brand on his hand._

> See, look at what my god gave me!

t!8ball Does Matthias blink from one side of the room to the other?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:20 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:20 PM)_

_Matthias laughs excitedly._

> See?

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:20 PM)_

> Eef...

_Emmett gives a weak thumbs up to Matthias, trying to be supportive of his newfound ability._

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:20 PM)_

> Sorry stranger, nobody cares about your god right now.

_KYL300 folds its arms._

> We need to get out of here.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:20 PM)_

_Matthias scoffs at the robot._

> Excuse me?

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:20 PM)_

_Emmett mutters, his body shaking more wildly._

> May Squoat have mercy on us all..

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:20 PM)_

_Chomsky, basking in the evening sun, mutters some noise to himself._

> Freef!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:20 PM)_

_Matthias balls up his fists, his brand glowing ever brighter._

> I don't think you know who I am...

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:20 PM)_

> I think Emmett'sss dying...

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:21 PM)_

> There are at least 200 Mantis soldiers coming our way. We need to leave.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:21 PM)_

_Chomsky's dumb smile is wiped from his face, finally taking Kyle's warning to heart. He turns back to the ship._

> Yeah, maybe.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:21 PM)_

> Well who's our co-pilot?

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:21 PM)_

> Ssseth.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:21 PM)_

> Seth, and he's stupid enough to try and kill and eat them.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

_Emmett starts to hallucinate from the violent effects of his grass withdrawals._

> What about Squanch?!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

> Okay, I'm just gonna sit back and meditate on this situation then. Holla' at me if you need help.

_Matthias heads back to one of the rooms and sits on the floor to meditate._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

> No one said anything about Squanch?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

t!8ball Do the Manti make peaceful contact?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

🎱 | Cannot predict now, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

> What are you talking about?

_Jim continues to smoke, now in the ship._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

_Chomsky sees that Matthias dropped a couple of feathers, his body molting._

> MATTHIAS!

_Matthias flips Chomsky off from around the corner._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

t!8ball Do the Manti make peaceful contact?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, Bagelwrecker.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

> I said at least twice that's a Mantis warlord dropship...

_KYL reviews its databanks to find out how many times it has warned the crew._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

_The Mantis warship lands, and a couple of unarmed Manti head to the ship. Jim sighs in relief at the sight of them._

> See guys, nothing to worry about.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

_Seth, having returned to the ship with some lumber, sees Emmett's state. He takes out a tool from the medbay and shoots Emmett with it to calm him down. However, this only results in Emmett's hallucinations to involve Seth's memories as well. Whoops! Wrong tool!_

> IT'S THE GRASSHOPPERS, SETH. THE GRASSHOPPERS!
> GET OUT OF THE WAY!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:23 PM)_

_`Mantis Ambassador`: The Mantis ambassador arrives to meet with the crewmembers just outside the Polonot with sacks of spuds in tow._

> `Mantis Ambassador`: HAVE FREE POTATOES, CITIZENS!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:23 PM)_

_Chomsky's face contorts in anger as he throws a potato back at them._

> WE DON'T WANT YOUR GARBAGE!

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:23 PM)_

_Emmett's body shakes on the ground out of his control._

> THEY'RE GONNA EAT MOUSE'S BODY!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:23 PM)_

_Jim rolls his eyes._

> "Welcome to Ireland" is all i heard.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

t!choose Kyle freaks out and kill a mantis | Kyle stays calm | Kyle stays calm

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

🤔 | ProfessorTree, I pick Kyle stays calm!

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

> GET AWAY FROM US YOU STUPID INSECTS!

_Chomsky waves his arms in the air angrily to try and scare the Manti away._

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

> GET INTO THE CRYOCHAMBER!

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

_Kyle puts an arm on Chomsky's shoulder._

> Chomsky, chill.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

_Matthias's meditation is interrupted by Emmett's yelling. He speaks into his comms._

> Oh hell no!
> I'm not doing that again.
> Last time that happened I came out 5 months later!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

> Why is everyone anngry and scared, its just a bunch of potato loving people...

_Jim eyeballs the Mantis ship, noticing its high-powered weaponry._

> ... That have military weapons.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

> Why don't we jussst ssstick Emmett in the cryochamber?

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

_Emmett exhales._

> I lived a good life. Emperor of the Bee Empire...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

> Because that's not a good idea.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

> Beesss?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

_Chomsky slaps KYL300._

> Shut up, robot!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

> He's obviously hallucinating...

\*Matthias is reminded of his past with Seth and a different Emmett and how they were trapped in cryostasis for 200 GUYs.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:26 PM)_

t!8ball Do the Manti start searching the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:26 PM)_

🎱 | Cannot predict now, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:26 PM)_

t!8ball Do the Manti start searching the ship?

_Emmett starts wheezing through his convulsions._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya Inspect Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, definitely, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

_Sanya tilts Emmett to his side, seeing his fur in clumps and his veins popping out._

> Hey, are you okay, Emmett?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:29 PM)_

> Emmett, you want to come over here?

_Seth grabs some of his lumber and forms a makeshift seat out of some of the logs._

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:29 PM)_

> He may be going through the Crave, as its informally called.

_KYL300 looks over to Seth._

> He's been without grass for a couple of weeks, yes?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:29 PM)_

> I found a blade of grass for you.

_Seth procures a single blade of grass, the blade partially wilted from the pollution on the warplanet outside._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:29 PM)_

> What'sss the Crave...?

_Sanya looks genuinely worried, as if she's grown a bit of an attachment to the goat pest._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:29 PM)_

t!8ball Does Chomsky get some grass for Emmett because he doesn't want to be eaten?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:29 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, PlasmaPerson.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

> After long periods of time without grass, Squoatlings begin to...

_KYL300 continues to check through the Llamanian information database on the Holonet._

> Lose their shit, if you will.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

_Chomsky, having left the ship for some grass, grabs a mix of weeds and wilted grass from the planet outside and returns with them._

> Okay, so I'm not sure what kind of grass it is but here you go...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matthias cloak himself with his newfound abilities?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, Enchantingtable2013.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

_Chomsky sticks the plants into Emmett's mouth, helping him chow it down. After a couple of moments, Emmett regurgitates it, the mix tasting awful._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

_Chomsky leans back in disgust from Emmett's display._

> Okay. Wrong grass.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

_Sanya eyeballs Chomsky with a hint of agitation._

> What did you feed him?

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

_Emmett's muscles tense up, their mass slowly bulkening up through some sort of hormonal imbalance._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

_Matthias smacks Chomsky in the back of the head rudely._

> Good job, dipshit.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 1, Zander.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

_Emmett's limbs pulsate, and his body slows its convulsions. He starts to snarl, emitting a very low growl._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

> What'sss happening to him?

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

> It's happening...

_KYL300 backs up from the others._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

> Maybe we could get Seth to take him to his homeworlds?

_Evidently, Matthias did NOT read Episode 5: Police Brutality. Nor did he pay attention to Emmett despite being in the crew for multiple GUYs at this point._

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

> He gets stronger and loses the ability to think...

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

_Jim takes out his cigarette from his mouth and irks in disgust._

> Is his arm... pulsating?

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

> Oh god...

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

_Sanya continues to stare at the squoatling on the floor, morbidly curious._

> What'ss happening?

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

> IT.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

> EVERYONE MOVE!

_Chomsky backs away in a hurry._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

> You're a robot! Put it more simply.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

_Seth, figuring now that Emmett is unresponsive, tries to grab him. However, the crowd around him makes this task much more difficult._

> GET HIM IN THE FUCKING ROOM!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

_Jim gasps and makes a redundant comment, as if something clicked._

> His body cannot handle the low grass rates in his body.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

_Sanya sighs from the stupid statement._

> I have no idea what that meanss.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

> We need to leave and get some grass in him...

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

> His chemistry is changing with his blood getting less grass.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

_Chomsky runs about in a circle in panic._

> WE NEED TO FIND SOME GRASS NOW!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

> Get your ass in the seat Seth, we're taking a road trip!

_Matthias shoves Seth towards the cockpit, who retaliates and shoves him back more aggressively._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya put Emmett in the cage Jim built?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

🎱 | Don't count on it, Brakia.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

_It appears that Jim has also been accessing the Holonet page that KYL300 is referencing._

> He might get stronger due to this, but his brain will lose functions quite slowly.

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

> Should I be worried?

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

_Emmett stares at the others above him, having just been able to open his eyes. The shaking in his body has stopped, and his muscles are now massive, like a bodybuilder's._

> I can still hear you guys.

_Emmett's teeth remain shown to the others, his snarl persisting._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

_Matthias frowns out of concern._

> Well, don't look into the light buddy...

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew travel to the nearest space Wal-Mart to buy grass?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:34 PM)_

_Emmett looks at his arms, his fur slowly darkening in color._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:35 PM)_

_Chomsky races to the cockpit, helping Seth decipher where the nearest store is._

> To the store!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:35 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matthias dash outside and look for grass?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:35 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, Enchantingtable2013.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:35 PM)_

> We need to find a plant-filled planet...

_KYL300 searches its navigational systems for the nearest gaia world._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:35 PM)_

> Emmett? Can you tell me what'sss happening?

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:35 PM)_

_Jim notices Emmett's expression._

> That doesn't look right...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:36 PM)_

_Matthias comes back from the environment outside, having not found a single healthy patch of grass._

t!8ball Does Matthias just console Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:36 PM)_

🎱 | Better not tell you now, Enchantingtable2013.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:36 PM)_

_After setting the ship to head to the nearest space Wal-Mart, Seth decides to not launch the ship and heads back to Emmett with his Desert Eagle in hand._

t!8ball Does Seth pistol whip Emmett, knocking him out?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:36 PM)_

🎱 | You may rely on it, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:36 PM)_

_Emmett stares at Sanya deliriously._

> My body is pretty much turning to its natural form...

_Seth pistol whips Emmett, knocking him out._

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:36 PM)_

> Hmm. Cool.

_Sanya watches idly as Seth knocked Emmett out._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:36 PM)_

_Jim picks up Emmett's head, his body being a bit heavier than before._

> Someone help me carry him in the cage...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:37 PM)_

> He's asleep, plantwoman.

_Matthias prepares to pick up Emmett's legs._

> I gotchu', homie.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:37 PM)_

> This is potentially dangerous. We need to help him...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:37 PM)_

_Matthias groans._

> No shit, sherlock.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:37 PM)_

_KYL300 points at Matthias aggressively, his voice changing to sound angry._

> I'm talking to Sanya, asshat.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

_Emmett quickly wakes up from the pistol whipping._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

_Jim glares at Matthias's, upset by his procrastination._

> Someone help me carry him, while someone else pilot the ship!

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

_Sanya just looks confused by the commotion._

> Oh.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

_Emmett's snarl furthers, his brow furrowing._

> Seth, don't be an asshat.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

> I tried.

_Seth frowns and backs away from him, not wanting to involve himself with Emmett's eventual rage._

> I'm gonna go smoke in the bathroom if you need me.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:39 PM)_

_Matthias picks up Emmett's legs._

> Lol, the cool kids vape.

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:39 PM)_

> We have weed, will that work?!

_Chomsky takes out a batch of space weed, presumably from Seth's stash._

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:39 PM)_

_Once again, Garrick's memory resorts to a holovision show._

> I am crazy weed!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:39 PM)_

> Yes make him eat Earth marijuana.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:39 PM)_

> Seth, we need you to pilot the ship.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:39 PM)_

_Emmett kicks Matthias's hands away, his body appearing to reverse the effects of Crave temporarily._

> Space weed is like space crabs...

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:40 PM)_

> What?

_Chomsky puts a hand to his chin, trying to understand the nonsense that Emmett just said._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:40 PM)_

_Seth puffs at a lit cigarette._

> Let me go finish my cigarette...

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:40 PM)_

> Finish it while piloting!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:40 PM)_

_Seth sighs dramatically and heads back to the cockpit. He sets the ship to autopilot after sitting in the pilot's seat._

> Finneee.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:40 PM)_

> No time to mess around man, get your behind in the seat!

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

_Emmett weakly feels his chin, his fur extending farther than usual._

> Am I growing a beard?

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

> Yesss...

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

t!8ball Does Kyle thank the Mantis people for their hospitality?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

🎱 | It is certain, ProfessorTree.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

> Wow, you finally look like a grown squoat!

_Matthias and Emmett share a soft chuckle._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

_Chomsky rudely interjects in their moment._

> Your entire body is basically a beard, get over it.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

_Jim helps Emmett to his feet, his legs wobbly._

> Emmett, can you walk?

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

> Probably...

_Emmett takes a step forward slowly._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

> We need to get you somewhere you cant hurt anyone.

t!8ball Does Jim help Emmett in the cell?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, TheBlade.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

> Please don't lock me up...

_Jim prods Emmett into the cell and locks it._

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 10, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

> Alright, this thing should hold up well if anything goes wrong...

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

_The moment Jim locks the cell door, Emmett turns back to him and growls loadly, his teeth flaring with murderous intent. His muscles bulk up to their max quickly and his fur darkens like before._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

> It's for your own good!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

> Cant take any...

_Jim jumps away from Emmett, his sudden transformation scaring him._

> OH SHIT!

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

_KYL peers at the transformed squoatling from around the corner in horror._

> Fuck!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

_Emmett attempts to break the cell, his arms managing to bend them slightly. He slobbers on the ground, growling at the others like a rabid animal._

**PlasmaPerson** _(25-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

_Chomsky heads to the brig to see Emmett._

> AAAAAA! WHY IS HE SUDDENLY SO BUFF!?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

_Seth heads to Emmett's cabin and slams on the door._

> Kambras, Emmett has the Crave again.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

> Guys he's getting stupider and stronger!

_Matthias looks at his brand, thinking of some way to subdue the enraged squoatling with his new abilities._

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

_Garrick speaks in a mix of GU Binary and Spectral in terror._

> HOLY 🅱️RAP!

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

_Kyle notices Emmett reaching out the cell and begins to panic._

> Get him in the cell! GET HIM IN THE CELL!!

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

> What'sss happening to him? Why isss he ssso buff?!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

_Jim snaps at KYL300, not wanting to be more stressed from this situation._

> He is in the cell!
> I locked it, we are good.

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

> How do we stop it..?

_Garrick digs in his pockets for something, waiting for an answer._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

> As long as no one breaks it...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

_Matthias watches Garrick appear from the wall in bewilderment._

> You feed it grass, stranger.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

> He's becoming insane. The Crave is affecting him.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:44 PM)_

_Emmett slams his head on the cell door, putting a small, but noticeable dent in it._

_Matthias slaps Kyle._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:44 PM)_

_Jim watches Emmett headbutt the door and sighs in relief, thinking it was secure to contain him._

> Thank god I took those welding classes.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:44 PM)_

_Matthias is suddenly reminded of his time in school back on Avos._

> Thank god I dropped out.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:44 PM)_

> Meat is strength!

_Emmett shakes the door ferociously._

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> Emmett!

_Garrick takes out a pride flag by accident, having expected to take out some grass. He points it in Emmett's direction regardless._

> U gay!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> No, grass is strength!

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

_Jim taps his head in a memetic manner._

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> That'll fix this...

_Garrick puts the flag back in his pocket, having thought of a new solution._

> What if I just possess him?

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

_Seth opens Emmett's cabin and yells into it._

> KAMBRAS! Emmett is dealing with the Crave again!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

_Overhearing Seth's yelling, Matthias groans._

t!8ball Does Sanya start following Emmett for research?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

_`Kambras`: Kambras wakes up, having just heard Seth's yelling._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

_Matthias watches Sanya start to take notes on Emmett's state._

> Don't be stupid, plantwoman.

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> Do I even have a brain...?

_Garrick looks up at the ceiling in thought._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> He'll eat you alive!

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

_Sanya ignores Matthias's jeers and continues to write down Emmett's state, growing more interested in his rabid state._

> Thisss isss neat... I ssshould write thisss down.

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

_Seth sighs over having to describe the Crave to Kambras._

> When he doesn't have grass.

**RPretribution** _(25-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

_Garrick looks at Jim as if he's stupid._

> I don't think that's how ghosts work.

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

> `Kambras`: Oh! I hope he's okay...

_`Kambras`: Kambras just remains in bed, confused._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

> Actually, that gives me an idea.

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

_Jim points at Garrcik with a wavering hand._

> Your body is made of neural transformations... you ARE a brain!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

> Happened once while you guys were having sex...

_Seth was trying his hardest not to just airlock Kambras for being slow. He also didn't want to remind her of "Emmett's First Time"._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

> Hey Floran, rip some of your hair off and feed it to him...

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:47 PM)_

_Sanya scoffs._

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:47 PM)_

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:47 PM)_

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:49 PM)_

_Jim's jaw drops on the floor from Emmett's sheer jaw strength._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:49 PM)_

> Jeez', Emmett.

_Seth lights another cigarette._

> You need to calm down.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:49 PM)_

_Matthias freaks out over the potential of being killed by a small, extremely buff goat._

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:49 PM)_

_Seth pulls a cigarette out of his pack and flicks it at Emmett's face._

> Have a cigarette or something.

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:49 PM)_

**Brakia** _(25-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

**TheBlade** _(25-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

**ProfessorTree** _(25-Aug-18 02:51 PM)_

_Kyle unleashes a sonic blast to knock Emmett out, it ringing in the ears of everyone around him at an extreme frequency._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(25-Aug-18 02:52 PM)_

_Somehow, Matthias's earholes were not affected by the sonic blast. A gift from Kluex, perhaps? Or just dumb luck?_

> The god of Avos has blessed me!

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:52 PM)_

_Seth clasps one of his sharp ears, still holding the cigarette for Emmett to grab._

**Zander** _(25-Aug-18 02:54 PM)_

_Emmett peers out of one of his eyes, pretending to have been knocked out from the sonic blast. His ears are ringing from the attack, with a tinge of blood flowing from one of them._

t!8ball Does Emmett kick the door up from him suddenly, slamming it down on Seth?

**Tatsumaki** _(25-Aug-18 02:54 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(25-Aug-18 02:58 PM)_

_Seth snaps in indignance at Emmett's behavior. He heads to Emmett's room, grabs Kambras by her ears, and heads to the airlock. In spite of her screams, Seth stomps to the airlock, and the crew does nothing to stop him. He gives Kambras a mocking salute and airlocks her off the ship, killing her for good this time._

_Seth smirks to himself as he thinks of some excuse for her disappearance._

Hey guys. Sorry about what happened earlier. I didn't think it would scare you that much.
I'm glad that you care about my wellbeing though.
I'll try to ration my grass if needed from now on. And I'll try not to attack any members in the meanwhile. (Sorry Seth!)
I only have only question however. Where did my llama friend go? I was going to speak with her tomorrow about something, but it seems she fled the ship.
Your Usual Pilot,
Emmett Tawfeek.
