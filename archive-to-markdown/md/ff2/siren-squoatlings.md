**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:00 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett take some of Maia's celestial grass?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 05:00 PM)_

🎱 | Likely yes, Zander.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:02 PM)_

_Emmett takes out a lighter and smokes a bit of the grass that Maia found._

> Much better...

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:02 PM)_

> How much longer?

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:02 PM)_

_Emmett blows out a satisfying puff of grass._

> Till'?

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:02 PM)_

_Ibraxas tilts his head toward Emmett, still concerned._

> You feeling good now?

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:02 PM)_

> I'm as fine as a fiddle.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:03 PM)_

> That's good.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:03 PM)_

> We'll be arriving at Rawny's in about fifteen hours.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:03 PM)_

_Lucian gasps at the time._

> You're joking right?

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:04 PM)_

_Emmett looks at a nearby window, seeing... nothing. Just a void._

> We're in deep space right now.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:04 PM)_

> Rawny's was banned on Earth for "unsanitary food".

_Seth sits down in a lounge chair and makes himself comfortable._

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:04 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Lucian go for space walk while attached to ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 05:04 PM)_

🎱 | Wait to ask this again, Arky.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:05 PM)_

> It's been a while since we've been in deep space, huh?

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:05 PM)_

> Fifteen hours, huh? I guess i'll get comfy.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:05 PM)_

> I mean, half the ship is unconscious. And yeah. It's been a while.

_Emmett takes a deep breath._

> Nothing much to see.
> Just really dark.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:05 PM)_

> Get used to not having space-link by the way.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:05 PM)_

_Emmett frowns._

> Isolated.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:06 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Ibraxas get comfy?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 05:06 PM)_

🎱 | YES, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:07 PM)_

> I guess I'll remove my this.

_Ibraxas points at his robot arm._

> The connector clamp has been kind of pinching my arm, and it needs a tune-up.

_Ibraxas starts to screw off his arm._

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:07 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth look in the fridge?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 05:07 PM)_

🎱 | Y35, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:07 PM)_

_Seth scrounges about the fridge, grabbing a pack of cheap beer._

> Any of you want a beer?

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:07 PM)_

> Does your arm continuously hurt you or something?
> And sure.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:07 PM)_

> I could go for one...

_Lucian feels his arm, a bit paranoid of the looming void outside._

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:07 PM)_

> Alright.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:08 PM)_

> It can if I don't tune it up. And I'll take a beer as well.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:08 PM)_

> Come and get it robo-man.
> That includes everyone else.

_Seth raises the pack._

> If you want a beer, get up and get it.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:08 PM)_

> Aw crap.
> I need my other arm on to open it.

_Ibraxas heads over to his cabin._

> I'll be right back.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:09 PM)_

> I was a bartender thirty years ago, not going to be one again.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:09 PM)_

> Point taken.

_Lucian walks over and grabs a beer._

> Thanks.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:11 PM)_

_Seth grabs two cans and heads back to the lounge, tossing one to Emmett despite what he just said._

> Ya' know, I miss being on my planet. The ladies loved me there.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes in envy._

> Last I heard, my planet was destroyed by the Llamanians.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

> I would've stopped it if I could.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett check outside the window?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

🎱 | Arky says yes, Zander.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

> I dont remember what planet I was born on, I was taken to Earth when I was little.

_Lucian sits back down._

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

t!choose Emmett sees Space Sirens | Emmett finds that they're heading into a very dusty and cloudy area | Emmett sees space rubble of a deteriorating ship

**Tatsumaki** _(05-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

🤔 | Zander, I pick Emmett sees Space Sirens!

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> Mmm...

_Seth downs about half of the can._

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

_Emmett stands on the tip of his hooves to get a better look out the window. He sees a beautiful blue squoatling, who waves to him in the depths of space._

> There's a squoatling outside the ship?

_Emmett's tail starts wagging._

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

_Ibraxas gets up from his seat, having gotten his beer-opening arm and beer can._

> What?

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

\*Seth yawns.8

> I doubt it. Probably a space siren, Emmett.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

> There's an elf, a squoatling, a tiefling, and a gaseous being all outside the ship.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

> I banged like ten of those, and let me tell you being cursed for ten years isn't fun.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

_Ibraxas sits back down, sighing._

> None of those are out there. They are all just space sirens.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

_Emmett frowns and puts his heels to the floor, looking back at Seth._

> Cursed?

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

> Oh yeah.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

_Lucian shrinks in his seat._

> Ignore them, I figure.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

> They curse those that they don't eat.
> If you look in their eyes, you're already cursed.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

_Emmett heads back to where he was seated and coyly smirks._

> To be honest, they look kinda' hot.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

> Shame really, Killed some of the greatest space pilots there were.
> Remember Goplor Starrlord?

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes, remembering all of the tabloids on that hack of a pilot._

> He's overrated.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

> Killed by sirens.

_Emmett's brow raises for a moment at the news, before returning to normal._

> The early days had some of the best, Emmett.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

> Take it they're nasty?

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

_Emmett scoffs and folds his arms, looking away._

> My dick has some of the best too. Don't see me boasting about it.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

_Seth turns to Lucian._

> Nope, very well versed in sex if you ask me.
> You can have sex with them. Just be careful...

_Seth grimaces from experience._

> They tend to like poking holes in space suits.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

> Is sex all you think of, Seth?

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> No.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

_Emmett looks out the window from his seat and notices the sirens changing their facial appearances intermittently._

> They look like they're both male and female though.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

_Seth takes another large sip of his beer._

> I think about the horrors committed by the llamas and the orcs sometimes.

_Seth glares at Lucian, who shrinks even more in his seat._

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> Kind-of a turnoff.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

> Intersex Sirens go for a pretty penny.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

> I don't think we should bring them aboard, price or not.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

_Emmett exhales audibly._

> Hey Seth. Remember that "squoatling" we got onboard once?

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Lucian go on a spacewalk to observe the creatures?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

🎱 | Maybe, Arky.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

> Mhmm.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Ibraxas tune up his arm?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

🎱 | Yay, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

> It was a shame she turned out to be a llama.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

_Emmett blushes a bit, thinking about his old girlfriend._

> I mean, although she was my enemy, I still liked her.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

> And you fucked the shit out of that llama.

_Emmett is suddenly grounded by Seth's bluntness._

> It made me feel like a proud father.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

> I just rigged up my arm with this old portable scanner, and I think it worked? I want to try it out.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

_Emmett holds his arms out._

> Scan me, amigo.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

> Alright.

_Ibraxas scans Emmett, and the arm emits a loud voice._

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

> `Ibraxas's Arm`: {Race: Squoatling}

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

> Hey, it works.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

> You want to look over the footage Emmett? I still have the holotape.
> It's titled Emmett's First Time.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

_Emmett's face scrunches up._

> I prefer not to show everyone else my dignity...

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

> It even has the part where I bust into your room and shoot her.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

> And then I ended up crying over my dead girlfriend...

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

_Seth was getting excited._

> Then we unmasked her, Scooby Doo Style.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

_Emmett looks away in despair._

> I kind-of didn't care, really.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

> Well, I'm going for a space walk, if I ask to be let in, let me in.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

> She was a nice lady.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

> Then you got really upset.
> And shot me in the foot.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

_Seth chuckles to himself._

> Ahhhh, memories.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Emmett shivers._

> You made me lick up the fluids afterwards. Disgusting.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

> Space rule 12 : Don't shoot unless you're ready to clean.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

> Like, you didn't even make me clean your foot.

> You made me lick a dead body.

_Emmett squeaks out the following uncomforably._

> It's like... necrophilia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

> But hotter.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

> I always knew you were a furry.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:34 PM)_

> I like banging women.
> That might include furry women.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:34 PM)_

_Emmett snaps his digits at Seth, in an intimidating manner._

> Keep your hands off of mine.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:34 PM)_

> As long as it has tits and a cunt it's fair game.

@Magic8Ball Does Seth look through a photo album titled, "Women I banged"?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 05:35 PM)_

🎱 | Nah, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:35 PM)_

> Hey Seth, look at this.

_Ibraxas scans Seth._

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:36 PM)_

> What is it?

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:36 PM)_

> `Ibraxas's Arm`: {Race: Elf}

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:36 PM)_

> Simple as that.
> It's really quick.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:36 PM)_

> Not that helpful if you ask me.
> Get me one that tells me if a woman has STDs or not.
> Also if you're going to use that thing use it on yourself.

_Seth scoffs at Ibraxas._

> Not me.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:38 PM)_

> I mean, it could be upgraded, like everything. But, I'm not going to upgrade it just so you can know who to bang or who to avoid.

_Ibraxas finds a port on the scanner and connects it to another port higher up on his arm, changing the voice to transmit to only himself._

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:39 PM)_

_Emmett smirks._

> Ibraxas, have you ever banged anything?

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:39 PM)_

> If you want to deal with a space crab infestation that's up to you.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:39 PM)_

> I'm like, less than a week old.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:39 PM)_

> Between the two of you.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:40 PM)_

_Ibraxas looks up at the ceiling, trying to remember whether Serpile or Bail ever fornicated._

> Not that i can remember, no. Neither of them had a loving enough relationship to warrant sex.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:40 PM)_

> You don't always need love.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:40 PM)_

> I wish I was able to have one.

_Emmett glares at Seth indignantly._

> But then someone needs to ruin my love.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:41 PM)_

_Seth nudges Emmett jokingly._

> Don't worry we'll find a nice goblin for you soon enough.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:41 PM)_

> I bet goblins are your fetish.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:41 PM)_

> I understand love isn't necessary, but without it, I'm just not interested.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:41 PM)_

> Goblins have good thighs, I'll tell you what.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:41 PM)_

> Same here, Ib.
> Aside from last time.

_Emmett remembers the last space station the crew went to and shivers._

> I was drugged.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:42 PM)_

_Seth rubs his tummy._

> Both cooked and uncooked, yum.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:42 PM)_

> That's why things like space sirens don't affect me.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:42 PM)_

> I highly doubt that.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:43 PM)_

_Ibraxas shrugs._

> I just see them for what they are.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:44 PM)_

> If I'd not known, I would've probably got them aboard.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:44 PM)_

_Seth is still going on about Goblins, practically salvating at the mouth._

> Goblins used to occupy that bar I used to work at all the time.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:44 PM)_

> But the strange thing is, both Serpile and Bail were affected by Sirens.
> I'm just an oddity.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:45 PM)_

> Then Space Rule 50 came along and fucked up goblins' place in society.
> The female goblins used to love me.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:47 PM)_

_Emmett puts his hoof to his chin._

> Y'know, I think Maia's a good addition to the crew.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:47 PM)_

_Ibraxas sneers at Seth._

> That's what you say about all female races.

> Me too, Emmett.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:47 PM)_

> This I'm not joking about.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:48 PM)_

_Ibraxas waits for a bit and smiles at Emmett._

> You know what I think?

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:48 PM)_

> Hm?

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:48 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Lucian reach for his necklace and remember memories of his sister?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 05:48 PM)_

🎱 | YES, Arky.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:48 PM)_

> I think that Maia is interested in our star pilot.

_Ibraxas nudges Emmett playfully._

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:49 PM)_

> You think?
> I mean, she did JUST join us.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:49 PM)_

> You two were too drunk to notice.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:49 PM)_

> Emmett is a very charming individual.

_Seth smiles and sits back arrogantly._

> He gets it from me.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:49 PM)_

> But there was definitely something.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:49 PM)_

_Emmett blushes and keeps to himself bashfully._

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:49 PM)_

> And his father.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:50 PM)_

_Lucian finally exits the ship in a spacesuit and floats through the darkness of deep space._

> I did it Lucy, I'm here!

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:51 PM)_

> I was in several wars on my homeplanet. War veterans are very respected where I come from.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:52 PM)_

_Emmett still is playing coy. It is clear that he likes Maia._

> I mean, Maia's an okay person...

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:53 PM)_

> You just don't feel the same?

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:53 PM)_

> I think... I don't know.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:53 PM)_

> He hasn't known her long enough.
> Give him a month or too.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:54 PM)_

_Emmett crosses his legs, smirking softly._

> I mean, we have had some nighttime chats here and there.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:54 PM)_

> I see.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:54 PM)_

_Seth makes a snide remark, muttering loudly._

> "Nighttime Chats".

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:55 PM)_

_Emmett laughs softly._

> Alright, alright. They're a little more than chats. I know you saw me asleep on her back once.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:55 PM)_

> We're fixin' to pass the Space Sirens.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 05:55 PM)_

_Ibraxas looks out the window._

> Oh really?

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:55 PM)_

> We should probably pull Lucian back in.

_Seth puts his comms watch to his mouth._

> We're going to be pulling you back in, Lucian.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:56 PM)_

_Lucian sniffles and nods._

> Alright

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:56 PM)_

> Yeah. She kind-of suggested it. I wasn't unclothed or anything.

_Emmett winks._

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:56 PM)_

> We're fixing to pass the space sirens, I don't need our space suits being damaged.

@Magic8Ball Does Seth pull Lucian back into the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 05:57 PM)_

🎱 | Likely yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:57 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Lucian leave the picture of him and his sister in space befpre going back in?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 05:57 PM)_

🎱 | NO, Arky.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:58 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Lucian see the sirens and see his sister in each of them?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 05:58 PM)_

🎱 | N0, Zander.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 05:59 PM)_

_Emmett whispers._

> Don't tell her this, but she's really soft.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 05:59 PM)_

_Seth heads over to the ship hatch and begins to pull Lucian back in._

> Remember that koala woman we had on our crew at some point?

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 05:59 PM)_

_Lucian sees a siren and sees a strange mix of his sister and some other hot devil lady in them._

> You're not real, but part of me wants to think that is you..

_Lucian starts to cry._

> Im sorry I couldn't protect you...

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:00 PM)_

> Lucian come in.
> We're fixing to pass by the Sirens.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:00 PM)_

> That koala woman was actually a robot.
> Serpile used her for scrap.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

_Seth clicks his tongue in disgust._

> What a waste.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

> Oh, I remember that...

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

> But Lucy... She's right there!

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

> She really liked Serpile too.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

_Ibraxas looks puzzled._

> Did she?

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

_The holovision turns on by itself, somehow._

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

> Well she was programmed to, at least.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

_Lucian finally notices he's getting pulled back to the ship._

> What the?

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

_Ibraxas shakes his head, thinking about it for a moment._

> Oh.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

> `News Reporter`: We interrupt this program to bring you the hottest space news.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

> I love this reporter.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

_Ibraxas heads to his room to get his tools._

> I'll take a look at the Holovision, see what's causing that.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:03 PM)_

> She always gives the best news.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:03 PM)_

_Ibraxas, from the hallway._

> You just like looking at her boobs.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:03 PM)_

> Best news.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:03 PM)_

> `News Reporter`: Vortox-56 has been reported to be 100% squoatling-free as told by the Llamanians, who told Deep Space News of an accident that occurred seven GUYs ago."

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:03 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do the sirens all grab Lucian?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 06:03 PM)_

🎱 | Yeah, Bagelwrecker.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Lucian cut his arm out?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 2! No, Arky.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

> `New Reporter`: The Llamanians have sent out a few hundred patrol ships to try and eliminate the rest of the squoatling race. They say it is some sort of gambling mishaps they need to settle.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

_Lucian tries to pull back, away from the sirens._

> Could you like, let go?

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Ibraxas save Lucian?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

🎱 | Bagelwrecker says no, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

> `Siren`: But big brother, I thought you loved me.
> `Siren`: Come explore space with me.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> Lucian, they're not real. Don't listen to them.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> `Siren`: We can be together again like old times.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:07 PM)_

> `News Reporter`: In addition, Space Disney's Squoatling Week was cut short by the Llamanians. Due to the events that took place during it, hundreds of the last known members of said race were kidnapped by the Llamanians and a video was posted of their execution.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:07 PM)_

_Seth taps his foot impatiently._

> Lucian hurry up and come in soon. you're pulling us a little towards the asteroid fields behind the sirens.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 06:07 PM)_

> If your really my sister, then whats the name of your favorite bear i got you?

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

_`Siren`: The siren pauses and thinks, clearly not knowing the answer._

> `Siren`: "Lucy."

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

> `News Reporter`: "There have also been multiple reports of people fusing all throughout the galaxy. It is unknown how or why this occurs. The changes are currently irreversible and the conglomerations believe they are a new person entirely.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

> Wrong!

@Magic8Ball Does Lucian get free?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

🎱 | Astounding yes, Arky.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> You wanna head to your home planet Emmett?

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

_Ibraxas joins Seth in pulling Lucian back._

> It never was your sister. There's no point in asking it any questions. It's just a cruel copy, set out to leech off the poor souls who are overcome by grief. I'm sorry.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

_Emmett is speechless._

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

> Emmett, I know the answer already, but, are you okay?

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

> You're the last of your kind now, I guess...

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:13 PM)_

> `News Reporter`: Lastly, there have been rumors about a bounty hunting crew traveling through deep space currently. This crew is manned by an outrageously tall elf and a strange human gas thing. The reason why we are broadcasting this is because of them amassing a huge amount of wealth, most importantly the Walt Disney Diamond, and not because I am being held at gunpoint. I am Barbara, and this is Deep Space News.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:14 PM)_

> Fuck.

_Seth and Ibraxas finally pull in Lucian and make sure the hatch is shut._

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 06:14 PM)_

> Its alright.

_Lucian pulls out Lucy's teddy bear from his coat pocket and holds it to his chest._

> I need a bit.

_Lucian strips the spacesuit and walks off to a... random closet._

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:14 PM)_

> Hey, they said I was manning the group. Neat.

_Ibraxas heads over the Emmett and slowly massages his shoulders._

> Emmett, how are you?

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:15 PM)_

_Emmett shakes and sniffles._

> Uhm...

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:15 PM)_

> We should probably ready our weapons.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:15 PM)_

_Emmett clears his contracting throat, trying to keep his sorrow in check._

> I-I'm the last squoatling then.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:15 PM)_

_Seth takes out his weapons and puts them on the lounge table, heading off to find more._

> Pirates like to occupy this part of space.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:16 PM)_

> You never know. There could be more...

_Ibraxas sighs._

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:18 PM)_

_Seth stops, finally taking in his son's sorrow._

> You want to watch some of your family's home videos, Emmett?
> I still got them.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:20 PM)_

> I don't know how to feel right now...

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:20 PM)_

> You don't have to.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:20 PM)_

> I think...

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:20 PM)_

> You want to know what makes me know how to feel?

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:21 PM)_

_Emmett's stomach rumbles._

> That I'm hungry.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:21 PM)_

> Sex and strippers.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:21 PM)_

> Ibraxas, we need to get you laid... back.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:22 PM)_

> _Ibraxas makes a face like the following. 😐_

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:22 PM)_

> _Emmett, having tried to ease his tension, makes a face like the following from his blunder of a joke. 😣_

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:23 PM)_

> I think I'm fine.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 06:23 PM)_

_Lucian puts the bear back and walks out, looking fine._

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:24 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett find a cake in the fridge?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 06:24 PM)_

🎱 | Wait to ask this again, Zander.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:24 PM)_

> I think it might be someone's birthday soon...

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:24 PM)_

> Is it yours?
> I always forget.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:25 PM)_

> I think it was Laav's.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:25 PM)_

> Laav's in space prison, isn't he?

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:26 PM)_

> Oh yeah.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:26 PM)_

> Something like that.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:26 PM)_

> He got arrested during our heist, what a shame...

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:27 PM)_

> I think it actually is Maia's.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:27 PM)_

> Oh.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:27 PM)_

> Well she's sleeping through her birthday.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:28 PM)_

_Emmett frowns, holding the cake he got for her._

> She has like a birthday every one hundred GUY's.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:28 PM)_

> I'm sure she won't mind.

**Arky** _(05-Jul-18 06:29 PM)_

> If it's hers, we should see if she doesn't mind.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:29 PM)_

> She might be in her sleepwear.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:30 PM)_

> Well, that's a bit... problematic.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:30 PM)_

> I'll go check.

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett find that she's in her sleepwear?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 06:30 PM)_

🎱 | Yeah, Zander.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:31 PM)_

> It's not too bad.

_Emmett comes back, flustered._

> She's sleeping hard though.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:32 PM)_

> Then let's wait until tomorrow. We don't want to disturb her.

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:32 PM)_

> I think I'm going to bed, guys...

_Emmett is feeling a mix of despair and horniness._

> This is rough.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:32 PM)_

> We understand.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:32 PM)_

> Alright
> Good night, Emmett.

**Brakia** _(05-Jul-18 06:33 PM)_

> Night, Emmett.

_Ibraxas waves Emmett off and leaves to his cabin._

**Zander** _(05-Jul-18 06:33 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett end up getting onto his possible crush's back?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 06:33 PM)_

🎱 | Likely yes, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:34 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Did Emmett like the taste of it?

**Magic8Ball** _(05-Jul-18 06:34 PM)_

🎱 | Nah, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(05-Jul-18 06:35 PM)_

> Space Rule 42: No extinctions.
