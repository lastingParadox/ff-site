**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 02:36 PM)_

_Sanya scoffs._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 02:38 PM)_

_Iris shakes her shoulders, startled from the bird's transformation. Emitting flame from her pores, Iris ignites, setting Qrow on fire._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 02:38 PM)_

_Sanya watches the display and scoffs. She looks back to the ground._

> I... I want to leave thisss group. Too much weird ssshit.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 02:40 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 02:41 PM)_

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 02:41 PM)_

_Sanya licks Iris in gratitude._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

_Chomsky stares at the sad, sad goat._

> Do we have anything to treat a concussion?

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

_Kyle takes out a syringe of liquid time and tries to inject it into Emmett. However, he misses, and the time spills on the soil, growing plant life._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

_Emmett cries loudly as he is taken off of Sanya._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

🐐 | The boat stops at the end of the river. A large castle stands ahead, adorned with gargoyles and sectioned into many parts of different colors. Several crowds of elves kneel in prayer at designated places of worship, and many others share toasts and games.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

_Seth hops off the boat and enters the castle, finding his way to the Death wing and handing his ticket to the gatekeeper, who lets him pass._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death grabs a lemon and squeezes it threateningly._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

> Why you gotta kill me?

_Seth pouts at the goddess._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

> It’s someone who raises you and loves you and supports you!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 02:49 PM)_

> Bahhhhh bahhh bahhh, bah bah bah.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 02:49 PM)_

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death widens her eyes and takes out her device, frantically trying to call her assistant._

> `Goddess of Death`: Shit, do I have the right Seth?

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 02:49 PM)_

> I have never felt half of thossse emotionsss.

_Sanya maintains a deadpan expression._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 02:50 PM)_

> Guys, if he's a baby, he needs a mom.

_Matieu turns his head and stares at Sanya with giant eyeballs._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 02:50 PM)_

> Come on, Sanya. It'll get him to shut up.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 02:50 PM)_

_Emmett frowns and bleats out._

> Sanya, pick me the fuck up.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 02:51 PM)_

> If he ssstartsss to do anything weird, I'm going to ssstab him.

_Sanya shows her teeth and snarls at Emmett._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 02:51 PM)_

> Ok, I was just joking before about killing him. Please don't.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 02:51 PM)_

_Her assistant, a small goblin-like creature with added elf ears, runs up to her frantically, handing her an antique scroll._

> `Goddess of Death`: "Seth Im'Kin'ki is your name correct?"

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 02:51 PM)_

> Help me find a cure.

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 02:51 PM)_

> I think he wants you to pick him up...

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

_A lightbulb lights in Iris's head._

> Hey, what do those herbs you found do, Sanya?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

> Ye'.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

_Sanya takes out the herbs from her pack and examines them._

> They look pretty. I don't know what elssse they do.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

> `Goddess of Death`: One second, let me check my records.

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death stares at the ancient scroll, giving a slight smirk for a moment._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

> t!8ball Does Sanya pick Emmett up and let him suckle on her breast?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, Bagelwrecker.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

> Probably dangerous. Best to choose a test subject first...

_Chomsky's smirk drops as he watches Emmett and Sanya._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

_Emmett looks up at Sanya in confusion, but after a couple of seconds, he licks at Sanya's puffy chest._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

_Iris looks away from Sanya andd Emmett, blushing from the two. She stares at Qrow's ashes and frowns._

> Now I wish I hadn’t set Qrow on fire.

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

> Mhm.

_KYL watches, unfazed._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

> Thisss isss extremely ssstrange...

_Sanya glares at Emmett and pulls away from him after a couple of seconds._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

_Chomsky pushes out a hand._

> Give me the plants. I'm sure I can whip something up.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

> Just let him sit on your back or something...

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

_In his desparation, Emmett can only muster a bleat._

> "I'm so sorry for this."

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

_The Goddess adjusts her glasses, looking down at her records._

> `Goddess of Death`: Hmmmm, it says here you made a deal with me and the Goddess of Love that gave you invincibility, but made you insane and required you to have sex every week.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

> Pretty sure I had sex every week.
> Ask my crew.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

> Sanya! Give me the plants!

_Chomsky shakes his hand wildly._

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

t!8ball Is Emmett slowly and steadily shrinking?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, ProfessorTree.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

_Chomsky watches Emmett start to shrink._

> Uh oh.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

> DON'T YELL AT-

_Sanya looks down at Emmett and freezes._

> Wwhy isss he ssshrinking?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

> `Goddess of Death`: Unfortunately, that'd be against the rules to take all your crew members to the river's docks, but you may choose one to testify for you.

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death takes out a finger._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

_Due to the effects of sipping the hag milk from last episode, Emmett begins to de-age...!_

_Emmett's voice pitch is going higher too, though it only makes his bleats even more annoying._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

> No seriously, I can fix this. Probably.

_Chomsky takes out his holodevice, pulling up JoyHole level 2 and looking for a possible solution to de-aging._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

> Fine!

_Sanya throws the plants forcefully at Chomsky._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

> Umm...

_Seth puts a finger to his chin in thought._

> I choose Emmett.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

> He's becoming a baby squoat...?

_Matieu raises an eyebrow, having never heard of this phenomenon._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett stick his tongue out?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, Zander.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

_Sanya looks down at Emmett._

> What are you doing?

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

> Alright, let's see what we have...

_Chomsky takes out his device and scans the plants Sanya grabbed._

> Wildroot, thunder weed, and purple azalia.
> Mixed with what I have... I can fix this.

_Chomsky's glasses shine in a moment of genius... or, so he believes._

> This is kind of an odd situation.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya perform the Lion King pose with baby Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

🎱 | My reply is no, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

t!choose fix Emmett | make him shrink faster | fix Emmett | turn into a regular goat | fix Emmett

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

🎱 | PlasmaPerson, I pick fix Emmett!

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

_Emmett continues to regress in age, somehow. He doesn't seem to be that worried, most likely due to his concussion._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

_Chomsky follows a guide he found on JoyHole Level 2 and mixes the herbs into a serum to reverse Emmett's de-aging._

> Here! Give it to him!

_Chomsky holds out the concoction to Sanya._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett drink the mix?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, Jelsafan0.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

_Sanya watches Emmett and notices that his snout seems to be protruding out more._

> He'sss growing hiss sssnout...?

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

_Chomsky shakes the mix._

> Sanya quick! Give it to him!

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

_Sanya smiles a bit at the pitiful sight of the squoatling shrinking in her lap. She looks up at Chomsky and her smile falls to a scowl._

> I don't have a free hand.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

> I’ll hold him.

_Iris sits down next to Sanya and holds her hands out._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

_Chomsky scoffs._

> Just shift him to your head.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

> He'll jussst ssscream.

t!8ball Does Matieu cut his artery and re-sew it for his own amusement?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, Enchantingtable2013.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

_Iris has a sense of panic in her voice._

> Then hold him with one arm!

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does the goddess of death bring Bee Emmett to the river?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

_Matieu continues to cut into his arm, cutting an artery within it and sewing it back up immediately like a psychopath._

> Hahah, this is fun!

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

_Sanya inspects Emmett, figuring that he looked about six GUYs younger or so._

> He's four-foot tall...

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

> Then put him down!

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

_Upon the vespoid being teleported to the heavenly river, Seth raises an eyebrow, puzzled by the person the Goddess of Death brought in._

> That's not Emmett.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

> It won’t matter in like ten to fifteen minutes.

_Iris is pulling numbers out of her ass, but her panic is very real for her friend._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

_Sanya smirks, looking up at Iris._

> Ssso I CAN kill him?

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Bee Emmett appears along the bank of the river. He has a detachable mane of soft fuzz and a stinger scepter in his hand. Despite his fuzz, his body is robotic, making him more similar to a wasphive in appearance._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

_Iris has a burst of anger from Sanya's question and stomps on the ground._

> No!

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

> Here...

_Chomsky crouches next to Sanya and awkwardly positions himself to feed Emmett while he's in Sanya's lap._

> I'll give it to him.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett looks about himself, confused how and why he was transported to this heavenly place. He notices Seth and tilts his head._

> `Bee Emmett`: Seth? Is that you?

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

t!8ball does Chomsky give the drink to Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

🎱 | It is certain, ProfessorTree.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

> My name is Seth, I don't know you though.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett spit the mix Chomsky feeds him out at someone?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, Zander.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

t!choose Sanya | Chomsky | Kyle | Iris

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

🤔 | Zander, I pick Chomsky!

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death sighs._

> `Goddess of Death`: This is your closest friend, I thought?

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_Chomsky jumps back from Emmett spitting on him, winscing from the concoction burning into his shoulders._

> AAAH!

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_Iris scrunches up her face._

> Yeouch....

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

> `Bee Emmett`: You look exactly like Seth!

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_Seth shrugs. Although he was once crewmates with this Emmett in the past, Seth did not recognize this robotic wasp person. Or maybe it was all just a ruse._

> My closest friend is a goat person named Emmett.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_Chomsky scratches at jacket, trying to wipe the mix off of him. This only rubs it into his fingers, burning him._

> It burns! What did I make?!

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_Iris shrugs and grabs the bowl._

> A cure.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

> It shouldn't burn!

_Chomsky gasps from the pain._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> I told you, I didn't know what thossse plantsss do.

_Sanya shrugs._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

_Seth facepalms._

> Jeez', you need to fix your fucking records.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> Please tell me he just didn’t spit it all out...

_Iris examines the bowl. It still had quite a bit of the mix left._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett's antennae lower as he's saddened by Seth's response. He was sure this was the Seth he knew from over two hundred GUYs prior._

> `Bee Emmett`: A goat named Emmett? Seth, you don't remember me?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> I don't know you.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

t!8ball Does Chomsky start to grow bigger?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

🎱 | Cannot predict now, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

_Seth rubs his face, it still stinging a bit from the burns, or at least, his perceived burns._

> I just burned to death about an hour ago.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

> `Bee Emmett`: You froze to death like two hundred GUYs ago...

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

_Sanya grimaces._

> I don't know how to fix thisss.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

t!8ball Does the mixture taste human blood and come to life?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, PlasmaPerson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

> I don't think so...

_Seth thinks for a second, remembering how he got here in the first place._

> Also did Matthias pass by the river? I kinda shot him down...

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

> Alright, down the hatch, buddy.

t!8ball Does Iris make Emmett drink the rest of the concoction?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, definitely, Jelsafan0.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death snaps her fingers, and her assistant comes back with a search for Matthias, wherever he was._

> `Goddess of Death`: No. He appears he went to Avian Heaven.

_`Goddess of Death`: The goddess continues to scour the inquiry, surprised by how Matthias is still alive despite being in Avian Heaven._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

> Down the hatch...

_Sanya watches as Emmett sips the murky liquid. She notices his throat not moving. Was Emmett not drinking it?_

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

> `Bee Emmett`: Matthias is frozen with you. I think...

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett looks down to the ground solemnly._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

_Chomsky takes off his coat so that it doesn't scald and potentially burn a hole in his shoulders._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

_Seth smirks slightly, remembering his rivalry with Matthias._

> No, I shot and killed him.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

_Chomsky notices holes in his jacket and scowls at Emmett._

> Great. Now I need a new jacket.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

_Emmett gives a gurgled bleat, some of the burning mixture going down his throat._

> Bah!

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

> Great. You’re cured.

_Iris backs off from Emmett, sighing in relief._

> not my problem anymore.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

_Chomsky notices that the serum has not had any effect on Emmett thus far._

> He's not cured! He's still a baby!

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

_Seth looks frustratedly over to the Goddess of Death._

> Anyways, can you please bring the right Emmett to vouch for me?
> Like, do your job?

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett looks away from Seth, practically having given up at this point._

> `Bee Emmett`: I know you always wanted to shoot him, but you never did.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

> Wouldn’t it take time to take effect?

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

> I'm not sssure....

_Sanya lifts Emmett's head up, causing him to clench his throat._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Chomsky notices Emmett's change in expression and realizes that he wasn't drinking the mix._

> He didn't drink it. He needs to swallow it.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Emmett is about 3.5 feet, his body resembling that of a 10 GUY old squoatling._

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Hector arrives from the swamp, having tried to grab debris and items left from the ship's crashsite._

> What happened?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Iris is losing her patience. She shakes Emmett's shoulders furiously._

> Swallow it if you want to live, Emmett!

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

_Seth frowns, a bit of his memory flooding back to him. He maintains his ruse to keep some leverage over the situation._

> He kinda went to another ship, because we went through a wormhole without protection, and then I shot that ship down.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

> Why is the squoatling so small...?

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:15 PM)_

_Kyle swivels his torso to Hector._

> He's shrinking, and he has the mind of the baby.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:15 PM)_

_Matieu decides to stop cutting and sewing himself up from Hector's arrival for a couple of minutes._

> Only Matthias knows...

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:15 PM)_

_From Iris's shaking, Emmett ends up spitting the serum onto the dirt._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

_Iris stops shaking Emmett and groans in frustration._

> Hnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.
> I give up.

_Iris sits down next to Sanya, defeated._

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

> What caused this?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu ponder about the wandering disciple?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

🎱 | Don't count on it, Enchantingtable2013.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

> Uhh...

_Chomsky shrugs._

> I'm not really sure.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

> Anyways, put that Emmett back and bring the actual Emmett here!

_Seth points to the ground._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death rolls her eyes and thinks of a new plan, having relied upon the vespoid to play into her desire to swindle Seth._

> `Goddess of Death`: Fine.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

> He'sss like, three feet tall now...

_Sanya notices that Emmett's clothes aren't shrinking with him._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:18 PM)_

t!8ball Does the Goddess of Death put away Bee Emmett and bring real Emmett here?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:18 PM)_

🎱 | My reply is yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:18 PM)_

_Matieu watches as Emmett shrinks._

> You better fix it fast!

_Matieu jumps back when he seems to just, disappear._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:18 PM)_

_Emmett bleats out before being teleported away to the heavenly river._

> I need grass.

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

> What the hell?!

_Kyle looks around for Emmett to no avail._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

_Seth beams as Emmett arrives in on the bank of the river._

> There you go... This is the right Emmett.

_Seth puts an arm around Emmett, who happens to be his normal height and self again._

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:20 PM)_

> Where'd he go!?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:20 PM)_

_Iris leans on Sanya and sighs, having matched her apathy towards the strange phenomena the crew frequents._

> I’m just going to sit down. I’m too tired for this...

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:20 PM)_

> Where did he go?

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:20 PM)_

> Guys, where did he go?

_Chomsky takes out his flamethrower._

> Who made him disappear?!

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:20 PM)_

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:20 PM)_

🤔 | ProfessorTree, I pick Bee Emmett switches places with Squoat Emmett!

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

_Emmett checks his hooves and looks around him, confused by how he's back to normal and with Seth, whom he thought had burned to death._

> Where the hell am I now?

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

_Sanya flinches from the sudden appearance of the vespoid, her legs bearing the weight of the robotic wasp._

> Who the absssolute FUCK are you?!

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett's antennae pop up the moment he's transported to the swamp, the sensors in his robotic body going haywire._

> `Bee Emmett`: Where the hell am I now?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

_Seth pulls Emmett into a hug. He was never more glad to see his son's face._

> Hey Emmett.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

> What isss happening?!

_Sanya tries to push the robot wasp off of her legs, however his weight was too much for her._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

> Give us Emmett back!

_Chomsky picks up a rock and throws it at the robot wasp, managing to hit Sanya instead._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

> Hey Seth...

_Emmett looks about him anxiously, not exactly liking being teleported to the unfamiliar place._

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

> What the fuck!?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

> Welcome to the afterlife river.

_Seth points his arm out, guiding Emmett's gaze around the river._

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

_Hector takes out his blaster._

> What did you do with the squoatling?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

> I'm dead...

_Seth frowns._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

_Iris lazily waves at the robot wasp._

> Hi. I’m Iris and I am so sick of all the weirdness.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

> `Bee Emmett`: Woah, woah! Get me out of your hands, plant!

_`Bee Emmett`: Bee Emmett tries to pick himself up, however Sanya maintains a grip on him._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

> Who are you and why are you ssso HEAVY?!

_Sanya manages to continue carrying Bee Emmett despite his weight._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:22 PM)_

`Bee Emmett`: t!8ball Does Bee Emmett try to fly out of Sanya's grasp?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:22 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

_Emmett, in his disbelief, repeats what Seth just admitted to him._

> Seth, are you dead or something?

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

> Sssheesssh, you're heavy...

_Sanya stretches out her arms and cracks them. Her arms were exhausted from carrying such a heavy robot._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

> Yep.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

_Emmett holds his throat._

> I think my larynx isn't working...
> The others hear me as a baby.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

> I burned to death having 69 sex with a female version of me.

_Seth shrugs._

> Not that weird.

t!8ball Does Bee Emmett do the Fortnite dance against his will?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

> And I'm shrinking...

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

> Mmm...

_Seth stares at the Goddess of Death._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

> You ssstill haven't anssswered my quessstion, bee.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

> Anyways tell the goddess here I had sex before I died.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris throw something?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

_Emmett raises his brow, confused, but he obeys Seth._

> He fucked all the damn time.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

> She claims I had a "deal" with her...

_Seth nudges Emmett to play along. He knew Emmett knew about his immortality curse, but he wasn't ready to give into the goddess's commitment just yet._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death folds her arms._

> `Goddess of Death`: It's true.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

_Emmett manages to understand what Seth's getting at and looks over to Seth, trying his best to not break character in Seth's ploy._

> Well, did you?

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

_Chomsky holds an EMP remote behind his back, which just happened to cause Bee Emmett to dance the Fortnite Default Dance._

> Stop dancing and state your business.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

> I didn't!

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett tenses his eyes, having figured out that Chomsky was controlling his body._

> `Bee Emmett`: This is your doing, fire wizard.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

t!choose Iris throws Bee Emmett | Iris throws Sanya | Iris throws Chomsky | Iris throws a Ribbon | Iris throws a rock

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

🤔 | Jelsafan0, I pick Iris throws Bee Emmett!

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

_Chomsky stops forcing the robot wasp to dance and scoffs._

> Wizard? Excuse me?

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

_Kyle draws his sword arm._

> Any sudden moves and you're dead, bee.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett flies away before either Iris or Kyle come towards him._

> `Bee Emmett`: Yeah. You made me dance or something.

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett shrugs, eight feet in the air._

> `Bee Emmett`: I dunno'.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

_Seth lies through his teeth, gripping Emmett's side to maintain his facade._

> I remember another Seth that had a deal with a goddess though, he was the first elf in 10,000 GUYs to get exiled...

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

_Emmett gasps in surprise at Seth's history legend._

> What the hell...?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:27 PM)_

_Seth glares at the goddess indignantly._

> Unfortunately, having sex with the goddess of death and the goddess of life is illegal.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:28 PM)_

_Emmett looks over to Seth confused. He manages to forget about continuing the ruse and mutters loudly to him._

> Wait, so you're condemned to live forever or something?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death pinches her brow in frustration. Emmett's slip up pointed out that the two of them were lying to her. She takes out her device and taps a button, causing another Seth to appear, a younger and more stiff clone of Seth._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

_Seth elbows Emmett's back from how loud he was being. The moment the clone appears, Seth gasps in surprise._

> Oh shit!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu stare in confusion at Bee Emmett, so astonished he stops self harming and repairing his arteries?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, definitely, Enchantingtable2013.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

_`Clone Seth`: The clone Seth looks at Seth inquisitively._

> `Clone Seth`: Who are you?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

> Um...

_Matieu blinks at the flying robot wasp._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

> I'm Seth.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

_Emmett points to himself with his whole hoof._

> I'm Emmett.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

_Iris rests against a tree, not interested in the conflict at hand._

> I'm exhausted.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

_Sanya's stomach (or the floran equivalent) rumbles._

> I'm hungry.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

> Guys, I think Emmett is trapped in the bee...

_Chomsky fires up his flamethrower at Bee Emmett._

> Kill him!

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett swiftly dodges the stream of fire._

> `Bee Emmett`: Okay, look.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

_Matieu recalls within his teachings of the disciple of Kluex about a vespoid comrade of his. He waves._

> Name's Matieu, Emmett.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Bee Emmett continues to stay above the others as a cautionary measure._

> `Bee Emmett`: You're not going to get me even if you tried.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

> I'm curious as to who this bee is and why they are here...

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

_`Clone Seth`: The Seth clone furrows his brow and snaps at real Seth._

> `Clone Seth`: I'm Seth and you aren't Emmett! Emmett is a bee not a dumb...

_`Clone Seth`: Clone Seth examines Emmett and takes a guess at his species._

> ... Goat-dog hybrid!

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

> `Bee Emmett`: I've been at this buzzness for 38 GUYs.

_`Bee Emmett`: Bee Emmett cringes at his pun, the robot husk causing him to glitch like that at times._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

_Matieu looks nervously up at Bee Emmett, as if he was some figure of reverence._

> Um, this is actually awkward. You have the same name as someone who... recently disappeared.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:31 PM)_

_Emmett's face scrunches up from the other Seth's attempt to insult him._

> Ouch.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:31 PM)_

_Iris glares up at Bee Emmett._

> My planet exploded. Your point?

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:31 PM)_

_Chomsky puts down his flamethrower._

> Yeah, whats that all about?

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:31 PM)_

> I'm ssstill confusssed. What isss happening?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:31 PM)_

_Iris stands, inquiring Chomsky's strange response._

> What’s what all about?

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:31 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Bee Emmett pauses, trying to recall an elf planet that exploded in the past 38 GUYs._

> `Bee Emmett`: Your planet needed to be exploded for the Demon Kingdom or something. You're a light elf, right?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

_Iris nods._

> Yes. There was a gas leak in the planet’s core and it blew up.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

_Matieu mutters to himself and continues staring up at the robot wasp in awe._

> This man must be the Vespoid Warrior...

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

> Sabotage was suspected. Why?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

> He looks like one.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett tries to recall the planet, the news not really concerning him much when it was broadcast across the galaxy._

> `Bee Emmett`: I believe some rogue Grasshoppers and Demons worked together to blow it up...

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett shakes his head._

> `Bee Emmett`: Anyhow.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

_`Clone Seth`: The clone inspects Seth top to bottom, flabbergasted._

> `Clone Seth`: Fuck, this is getting confusing.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

> `Bee Emmett`: I'm here due to Seth's stupid hijinks.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

_Emmett looks between the two Seths, also confused by the other Seth's presence._

> So you two are both Seth Im'Ki'nki?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

_Iris looks up in surprise._

> Oh, Seth? He died.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

_Hector scratches his chin._

> Seth is the pilot right?

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Bee Emmett sighs, looking back fondly at the days when he and Seth were crewmates._

> `Bee Emmett`: I'm the pilot!
> `Bee Emmett`: Or I was...

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

_The two Seths check each other out, mirroring each other._

> Fuck.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

> `Clone Seth`: Fuck.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

> Ummm...

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

_Hector tilts his head._

> What do you mean was?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth and Seth point at each other and say, "Same sleaze"?

t!8ball Is Kyle running low on power?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

🎱 | You may rely on it, ProfessorTree.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

_The two Seths squat an point to each other, exclaiming, "Same sleaze". They both are taken aback by the others' response._

> No, you're the sleaze!

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

_Kyle's lights start to dim, indicative of his body warning him of low power._

> My power is running low...
> Where's my charger?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

_Matieu smirks and snaps at Kyle._

> Up your ass!

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

_Iris grimaces from Matieu's inappropriate response._

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:35 PM)_

> Matieu!

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:35 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett puts a robotic finger to his mouth, as Matieu's response prompts him to recall more of his past with Matthias._

> `Bee Emmett`: Oh yeah. Matthias had like a bee egg in his ass.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:35 PM)_

_Matieu winks at Hector._

> Gotta' show the hot ladies my dominance!

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:36 PM)_

_Hector puts both sets of his hands on his hips._

> There are humans around!

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:36 PM)_

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death smiles devilishly, having completely formulated how she'll tighten Seth's contract._

> `Goddess of Death`: Alright, let's clear this up.

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death points to Seth, and then the clone Seth._

> You, Seth 1, died of burning to death. You, Seth 2, died of freezing to death.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:36 PM)_

_Emmett is getting confused, considering that the other Seth seemed to be in Elf Heaven first._

> No wait.
> My Seth is Seth 2.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:36 PM)_

> No, we'll say I'm Seth 1 considering I died first.

_Seth shrugs._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

> By the way!

_Iris points at Bee Emmett._

> You called me a light elf. I’m half archidemon. Don’t forget that!

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

_Sanya starts to tire of this conversation, more interested in getting something to eat._

> Guysss, we ssstill don't have a ssship...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

_Matieu flips Sanya off._

> I don't give a fuck.

_Matieu sticks a hand in his pants and takes it out, flicking a wet substance in her direction._

> Suck my dick.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

> Then we’ll stay here until we get one...

_Iris whole body is repulsed from Matieu's vile display._

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

_Kyle speaks up a bit louder for the others to hear, trying to conserve its energy._

> ... Where's my charger?

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

t!8ball Does Bee Emmett call up his ship yet?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

🎱 | Don't count on it, Zander.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

_Sanya hisses at Matieu aggressively._

> I'm going to ssstab you, bird.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

_Iris mutters, still visibly disgusted._

> Who are you talking to, Matieu...?

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

_Chomsky frowns._

> Uh, I think it was on the ship, Kyle.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

> `Goddess of Death`: Seth 1, you died while having sex, thus meaning you wrongfully died.

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death rolls her eyes._

> `Goddess of Death`: Seth 2, you died without having sex for two hundred GUYs."

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

_Matieu takes out his scalpel threateningly._

> Not if I cut your veins open.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:37 PM)_

_Chomsky shrugs and pats Kyle on the back._

> Whoops.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_Sanya scoffs._

> I don't have veinsss. I'm a plant.

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_Kyle glares at Chomsky._

> ... The ship that sank... in a pit... of quicksand.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_`Clone Seth`: The clone Seth shrugs, not caring much about what the goddess told him._

> `Clone Seth`: Heh, cool.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

> Don't you have a solar power option or something?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_Matieu smirks and puffs his chest out._

> I know the perfect place to flick your skull that'll collapse your brain...

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_Sanya stares at Matieu as if he's stupid._

> Again, plant.

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_Kyle's lights change to a dim red, its voice raising in anger._

> So, you're telling me... I'm gonna fucking shut down... because nobody grabbed my charger?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_Iris frowns from the conversations she's bearing witness to._

> This got very dark very quickly.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death smiles sinisterly._

> `Goddess of Death`: That means that our deal is tainted and will have to be remade.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

> Everyone calm down, we need to try and find a way out of this forest...

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Bee Emmett rolls his eyes and digs in his pack._

> `Bee Emmett`: Ugh. Robot guy.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_`Clone Seth`: Both Seths get a rouse out of the goddess's choice of words._

> `Clone Seth`: Heh, taint.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

> Heh, taint.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Matieu shakes his fist._

> I'll put you in a goddamn salad!

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Chomsky looks guilty, considering that he could have easily grabbed the charging port when grabbing his stuff from the sinking ship._

> We'll charge you up if you shut down...

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett takes out a gold battery with six tesselating hexagons on each of its sides._

> `Bee Emmett`: Do you want my bee battery?

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Sanya takes out her dagger._

> I'll kill you before you take a ssstep, bird.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Iris looks up at the battery, squinting._

> What is a bee battery?

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

> ... Not sure it'll work...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Matieu flips off Sanya with both hands._

> Go fuck yourself.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_`Goddess of Death`: Upon deciding that Seth's contract will be amended, the Goddess of Death calls the top contact on her speed dial._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Sanya licks her teeth and grins devilishly._

> I heard avian tassstesss great!

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

> `Bee Emmett`: Let me try it out.

_`Bee Emmett`: Bee Emmett takes out an extension cord and lands next to Kyle._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

> I don't like salad, but I'll still devour you.

_Matieu winks._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

_Iris groans loudly, getting in between Sanya and Matieu._

> Can you two please not fight?
> PLEASE?

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

_Sanya glares at Matieu, moving her head around Iris._

> Ssshut up, Irisss.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

> `Goddess of Love`: Why'd you call me, Lora'ainne?

_`Goddess of Love`: The Goddess of Love wraps an arm around the Goddess of Death's neck in a provocative manner._

> `Goddess of Love`: I heard Seth needs to amend his contract?

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

_Hector places a hand on Matieu's shoulder._

> Matieu! Leave the Floran alone!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

_Matieu grits his beak._

> How about you shoot her ass in the skull and then I'll stop fighting.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett attaches the battery to Kyle's port via double-extension cord._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

_Chomsky jumps up and down, giddy for a showdown between Sanya and Matieu._

> Fight! Fight! Fight!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

_Matieu holds his scalpel at Chomsky threateningly._

> Shut the fuck up, human!

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

> Stop! Everyone! We need to try and find civilization!

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

_Emmett looks around, wanting to join the others back on Lama'entria._

> Get me out of here!

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death rolls her eyes and shoos Emmett._

> `Goddess of Death`: Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

_`Goddess of Death`: The Goddess of Death taps a button on her device, teleporting Emmett back to the swamp with the others._

> `Goddess of Death`: Here you go, goodbye.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

> Please fix my voi-

_The two Emmetts are swapped, with Bee Emmett teleporting back to the Elf Heaven river, and Squoatling Emmett back to the swamp._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

_Iris takes out her hands and produces fireballs, threatening both Matieu and Sanya._

> Don’t make me set your pants on fire!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

_Matieu's eyes boggle at Iris's curvy features, given that she's facing Sanya._

> Civilization here? This forest is thicker than Iris!

_Matieu chuckles to himself and takes out his gun, pointing it at Sanya._

> I mean, what?

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

_Kyle takes a moment to feel out the new battery's power._

> ... I'm charging at a rate that would give one percent more battery an equinox...

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

_Iris growls at Matieu, turning to him._

> What?!

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Just as Emmett was done hooking Kyle up, he was teleported to the river once more._

> `Bee Emmett`: Oh, fuck me.

_`Bee Emmett`: Emmett groans._

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

> We can all go get something to eat and then calm down...

_Hector stands next to Iris, holding all four of his arms out between Sanya and Matieu._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

_Sanya salivates, ready to pounce on her prey._

> Sssomeone wasss never told about the bloodlussst and the cruelty of the floransss. How about I teach you!

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

_Kyle looks around to thank Bee Emmett, but it doesn't find him._

> ... What...?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

_`Clone Seth`: The clone Seth smiles upon seeing the robotic wasp body, having all of the memories of a Seth from two hundred GUYs prior. He assumes that Bee Emmett had to become a robot to still be living after all of these GUYs._

> `Clone Seth`: Oh hey Emmett, you die too?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

_Iris's fireballs blaze larger._

> Stop fightinggg!!!

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

_`Bee Emmett`: Bee Emmett's antennae pop up in surprise from the clone Seth acknowledging him._

> `Bee Emmett`: No, Seth. I've been looking for you for two hundred GUYs.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

> Okay, everyone, break it up!

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

> `Clone Seth`: Oh, Goddess Ameno says I froze to death.

_`Clone Seth`: Clone Seth shrugs._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

> `Bee Emmett`: Damn... I figured as such.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

_Upon returning back to the swamp, Emmett just so happens to be his normal size. While his concussion has miraculously subsided, he still cannot speak properly from his busted larnyx. He bleats out loudly, his throat paining him._

> BAH!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

> Why can't the floran just sleep on the floor?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

_`Clone Seth`: Clone Seth points at real Seth._

> `Clone Seth`: Yeah, but this Seth died while having sex.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector step between Sanya and Matieu, breaking up the fight?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, MultiTheDuck.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

_Chomsky does a cartoonish double-take at Emmett's presence._

> Emmett!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

> God damn, Hector. I was about to shoot her salad finger lookin' ass!

_Matieu scowls and puts down his gun._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

> Why don't you sssleep in a bird cage?

_Sanya folds her arms and looks away from Matieu._

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

> Hey.

_Kyle gives a pathetic wave towards Emmett._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

_Emmett coughs loudly._

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

> Just leave them, Matieu. This group is our best bet of getting off this planet.

_Hector pats Matieu on the shoulder._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

> Hey, you ever tried committing self-airlock, you sick fuck?

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

> Something weird is happening, Emmett! Please make it stop before I light everything up.

_Chomsky taps his goatse impatiently._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

_Emmett stands on his two feet and attempts to walk._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya's bloodlust overtake her?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

> Oh. Right.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

> I will kill you if you ever talk about hurting anyone.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

_Hector points feverishly at Sanya._

> Why is the plant twitching?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

_Iris notices Sanya's growing rage and holds a fireball closer to her._

> Sanya! Fire! I will set your pants! On fire!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

> Because it wants to kill someone.

_Matieu shakes his big bird tail at Sanya and spanks it._

> COME GET ME, YA BIG WANK!

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

_Sanya's head twitches eerily and she pauses, before taking on a completely new composure. She stares right through Matieu._

> I going to rip your head off and use it as a bowl to eat your fucking organs, you feathered bitch.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

> Matieu, no!

_Hector grabs Matieu for his safety._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

_Matieu shrugs off Hector and sticks his tongue between his feathers to piss Sanya._

> I can outrun this fat fuck for days.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

> Wai-

_Emmett coughs abruptly..._

> -t!

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

_Kyle speaks in a low tone to conserve energy._

> He speaks.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

> He's talking!

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

_Iris steps between them, fire on her finger pointed at Matieu and dagger in her hand pointed at Sanya._

> Shut the hell up and listen!

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

_Emmett struggles to yell out for Hector, his throat causing him to expel a mix of a bleat and speech._

> BAH-DOC!

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

> Have you ever felt dread, bird? I have.
> And now I know what all my targets felt when they found out I was the one hunting them.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

_Hector turns his head toward Emmett, creaking like a wooden door without lubricant._

> Yes...?

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

t!8ball Does everyone stop fighting to realize the miracle of Emmett's first steps?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

🎱 | My sources say no, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

_Emmett points to his throat._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

> Wow, finally someone got their translator working properly!

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

> What?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

_Iris rolls her eyes and speaks plainly for the doctor._

> His throat. He wants you to fix his throat.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

> Is there something wrong with your throat, squoatling?

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

_Emmett points to his throat._

> Bah!

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

> I can examine it if needed...

_Hector crabwalks to Emmett, keeping an alert eye on Matieu._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris look extremely threatening, despite not being very tall or strong?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, Jelsafan0.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

> Okay, now that it's working...

_Matieu turns away from Emmett and towards Sanya._

> I need you to calm the fuck down.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

> I've stared gods in the eyes, bird. I've killed kings and emperors. I've realized just who I am. I am Dread.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

_`Dread`: Sanya- er, Dread snarls at Matieu with a more foreboding aura than ever before._

> `Dread`: And you are PREY.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

> I don't give a fuck if you're Dread or a bag of baby squoatlings.
> I'M FAST AS FUCK BOII!

_Matieu runs around in circles to prove his point._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

> WOULD! YOU! STOP!

_Iris completely ignites her body, causing the nearby grass to singe._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread roars loudly, spitting up tar for a brief moment. The ground shakes._

> `Dread`: SHUT THE FUCK UP!

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

> I'm going to have to put you under for a while while i try to fix your throat. Do you trust me?

_Hector pulls out some anesthestic syringes from his pack._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_Matieu wobbles for a moment, but gains his footing and points at Dread angrily._

> NO, YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP!

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_Iris whirls on Sanya with her dagger raised and fire in her hand._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_Emmett gives an uncertain nod and lies down on the ground for Hector._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

> Don’t make me do it.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

> `Dread`: I do not fear your flames.

_`Dread`: Dread flickers its tongue at Iris impishly._

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

> Alright, this is going to sting for a little while, then you will not feel a thing...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

> Look plant-woman, calm down and just take a break by doing some Sugondese training.

_Matieu thinks of the Avian art of prostitution and smirks, unfazed by Dread's threats._

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

_Garrick emerges from within Chomsky's backpack. Seems he has been hiding in there asleep for some time._

> Sugondese nuts.

_He munches on some of Chomsky's trail mix._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

_Chomsky, aware of Garrick's tendencies, hurriedly checks his backpack to make sure nothing was stolen._

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

> Okay, I'm going now.

_Garrick disappears back into Chomsky's bag._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu start doing The Shoot, a dance from an Avian brothel, for no goddamn reason?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook not so good, Enchantingtable2013.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

_Iris jumps a couple of inches from Garrick's sudden appearance._

> What the heck, Garrick?!

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

_Hector is taken aback by Garrick's appearance._

> Who is that?

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

_Garrick cheers with a full mouth, deep within his buddy's rations._

> Do the shoot!
> Does he do the shoot!?
> Yes...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

_Matieu smells the air, a foul stench starting to emanate from Dread._

> I'm pretty sure I'm high, fellas!
> WOOOOOOO!

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

t!8ball Does Kyle turn on the switch to the bee battery?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, ProfessorTree.

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

_Kyle shakes with instanteous energy from the bee battery, his body jolting up with vigor._

> OH FUCC!

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

> No matter, Emmett I'm going to inject you now. We will need to wait for it to take effect on you.

_Hector takes a syringe and injects it into Emmett's neck. Emmett winces from the initial sting, but then dozes off._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

> Hey, and Iris, I can hook you up with that good stuff if you dig.

_Matieu gives Iris a wink wink._

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

> LISTEN UP FUCKERS! BACK OFF OR YOU'RE BOTH DEAD! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

_Kyle takes out his arm cannon and charges it up somehow past its limit._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

_Iris extinguishes her fireball, holding up a ribbon._

> Stop.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

> `Dread`: LEAVE US, ROBOT!

_`Dread`: Dread's snarls, his mouth foaming and drooling tar._

> `Dread`: You are not a part of this fight.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

> C'mon, I got the good shit, Iris! Just meet me at eleven o'clock, on the dot.

_Matieu gives Iris another wink and makes a suggestive scissoring motion with his feathers._

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

_Kyle points his blaster at Matieu, and then at Dread._

> I SAID BACK OFF!
> OR!
> YOU'RE!
> DEAD!

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

> Kyle, chill!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

> Fine, Kyle.

_Matieu grumbles and backs away from Dread._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

t!8ball Does Bee Emmett's ship arrive?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

🎱 | Signs point to no, Zander.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

> I got better things to do.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Matieu folds his arms and scowls._

> Like, fuck bitches.

_Matieu takes a second to think about what he just said and hits his chest twice._

> I mean respect.
> Respect women.

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

> THE EXCESSIVE POWER IS CORRUPTING MY DECISION MAKING SKILLS!!

_Kyle shakes his arm cannon uncontrollably._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Dread glares at the robot and snarls._

> `Dread`: You have no blood. I have no use for killing you. But if you continue your plight, I will end you.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Iris snaps her head in Matieu's direction, staring daggers into his very being._

> Matieu.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Garrick considers unleashing his unlimited power on Dread and/or Matieu._

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

> Sleep squoatling, I'll start soon...

_Hector pats Emmett on the shoulder and looks through his bag for more tools._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Matieu is enchanted by the hateful look given to him._

> Iris, I'm gonna respect you so hard.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Hector cups his hand over his mouth._

> NOW EVERYONE, STOP FIGHTING!

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Iris holds up the ribbon threateningly._

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Garrick pops out of Chomsky's bag, pointing Chomsky's flare gun randomly._

> Fear my powag!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

> C'mon, you know you wouldn't do it.

_Matieu gives a big beaky smiles, his brow guilty._

> We're cool, right?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

_Iris maintains a stalwart glare in Matieu's direction._

> Wouldn’t I?

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

_Hector flares out his syrings._

> ...OR I'LL KNOCK YOU ALL OUT SO I CAN SAVE THIS DAMN SQUOATLING!

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

> I have ammonia if you need Emmett to stay still.

_Without even turning around, Chomsky pops a bath-bomb in Garrick's mouth, who swallows it._

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

_Kyle shoots three blasts into the sky._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

_Iris's tone is cold. She sure as hell would attack Matieu._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

`Dread`: t!8ball Does Dread emit an aura of pure dread?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, Brakia.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

_Garrick puffs up like a balloon with a sweet scent. Bubbles emit from his nostrils._

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

_Hector scowls at Chomsky and Garrick's shenanigans._

> I have enough, thank you.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

_Matieu drools thinking of Iris..._

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 03:59 PM)_

> Matieu, help me move this squoat away from the area so I can fix him!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 03:59 PM)_

> Sure!

_Matieu races over to Hector and helps pick up Emmett._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

> `Dread`: Get out of my way, Iris. Or you will be killed.

_`Dread`: For a moment, Dread flashes a somber look, then smiles._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

_Matieu looks back at Iris and smirks, giving her one last wink._

> Catch you later, momma!

_Matieu clicks his tongue._

> Eleven o'clock, remember!

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

> Are you okay now, Sanya?
> Are you going to commit murder if I let you move?

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

_Garrick bubbles up some bad advice._

> You should. Murder away, Sanya!

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

> `Dread`: Move. Now.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

t!choose Place Emmett in a clearing | Place Emmett in a lakeside

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

🤔 | MultiTheDuck, I pick Place Emmett in a clearing!

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

> If. You. Go. Will someone die?

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

> Okay here we go, this clearing will work

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

_Dread smirks and speaks to Iris playfully._

> `Dread`: If you don't, you will die...!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

_Matieu puts on his surgical gloves to assist Hector in surgery._

> What op', Hector?

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector successfully fix Emmett's throat, asking Matieu for various items throughout the surgery?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, MultiTheDuck.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett start screaming 6 times louder than before because he does not have Sanya?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, PlasmaPerson.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

_Matieu wipes his brow from sweat._

> Glad we were able to patch him up, doc'.

_Unfortunately, the procedure causes Emmett to howl in pain, the anesthesia fading off a bit too early._

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

_Kyle shoots a blast near Dread so close to him that it nearly grazes his leg._

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

_Garrick holds the sides of his head, assumably his ears._

> That's loud!

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

> Cool.

_Iris punches the palm of her hand threateningly._

> I get to see my parents, my cousin, my best friend, my aunt, my uncle. I don’t fear death.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

_Matieu covers Emmett's mouth, grimacing._

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

> Back the fuck up, Sanya!

_Kyle charges up another shot._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

> `Dread`: Good. It will be easier to kill you then...

_`Dread`: Dread laughs, flipping Sanya's dagger between his fingers._

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

_Garrick takes a hand from one of his ears and points the flare gun at Dread._

> I WILL KILL YOU 10!

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_Chomsky immediately starts to dance, provoked by Emmett's loud screaming._

> AAAAA! FORTNITE!

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_Garrick pokes at Chomsky as he dances, singing a nursery rhyme._

> If a man came into your room and did a funny, would you scream or cry?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris’s anger at the new knowledge that her planet was intentionally blown up make her more scary?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

🎱 | My reply is yes, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_Emmett finally stops screaming._

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

_Hector sighs and lightly pets Emmett's head._

> It's okay squoatling, you'll be fine in no time...

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

_Garrick takes his other hand off his ear._

> Thank God, you were hurting my nonexistent ears!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu instantly dash back to try and pull Iris away from Dread?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

_Matieu grabs at Iris's arm and tries to drag her off to no success._

> What's up, baby girl?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

_Iris grimaces as Matieu tries to pull her away and remains standing stalwart, her stare remaining on Dread._

> I just found out someone orchestrated the murder of everyone I ever knew and loved. You don’t wanna screw with me right now.

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

t!8ball Does Kyle grab Matieu by the throat and throw him at Dread?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, ProfessorTree.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread scoffs._

> `Dread`: You're trying to intimidate a god, girl.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Iris raises an eyebrow._

> What’s your point?

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

> I'll kill you in an instant, plant. Back. Up. Now.

_Kyle closes some distance between itself and Dread, pointing his cannon directly at her face._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Matieu stops pulling at Iris, realizing she wasn't listening to him._

> Aye', you listening Iris?

_Matieu looks away and thinks aloud._

> Or is she still upset?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth finish up his contract with goddesses and proceed to crawl out of Emmett's mouth now?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, Bagelwrecker.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Matieu gives Iris puppy-dog eyes._

> Do I need to apologize?

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Garrick looks around at the others, having not paid a lick of attention._

> Hey, why's everyone mad?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

> Honey, I'm home!

_Seth steps out of Emmett's mouth cartoonishly and poses heroically._
_He is wearing a completely different outfit than before, and holding a pile of shredded Elven clothes._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Matieu gasps at Seth's revival._

> OH SHIT!!

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Hector gives Seth a wide-eyed stare._

> Dear god...

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Iris rolls her eyes._

> Yes, please apologize.

_Iris turns her head towards Seth, keeping Dread in her peripheral vision._

> Hello Seth!

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Chomsky's jaw drops to the ground, having watched Seth appear out of Emmett's mouth._

> OH GOD, SETH, WHAT THE HECK!?

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

> Why were you in him?!

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread hisses at Kyle, pointing Sanya's blade to the robot._

> `Dread`: Robot, leave this battle. NOW.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Matieu gives a wink to Dread._

> Sorry, Miss Dread Goddess...
> It's not a battle, dayum!!

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

_Kyle scoffs, believing his plasma cannon could easily destroy her at this range._

> YOU leave this battle before you get incinerated!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> Sorry for pissing you off somehow...

_Matieu looks away, his apology clearly not genuine._

> Don't sleep on it.
> You'll only get four hours.

_Matieu winks at Iris suggestively._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

_Seth points a big finger at Kyle, clearly not understanding nor caring about what's happening currently._

> How about YOU shut the fuck up, Mr. Roboto?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> Hey man, don't be a dick!
> He's just trying to help!

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> Oh, hey. Seth's back...

_Kyle rolls its mechanical eyes and flicks Seth's nose away._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

_Emmett is underneath Seth's feet._

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> The plant's rebelling, Seth!

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_Seth shrugs and gives an apathetic look._

> Just burn it to death.

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> I probably will at this rate.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth feel rejuvenated?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

🎱 | It is certain, Zander.

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_Kyle changes his arm weapon to his flamethrower._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_Iris holds a ball of flame in her hand, considering lighting Dread ablaze._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_Feeling good after his unseen escapades with the two Goddesses, Seth looks around for his squoat boy._

> Oh hey, where's Emmett?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

> My fire can’t be extinguished.

_Iris gives Dread a proud smirk._

> It’s dangerous...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

_Matieu crosses his legs, his body tingling from Iris's badassery._

> My burning love for you can't be extinguished.
> It's dangerous...

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

_Iris's mouth quivers and she brings her fireball to Matieu's face._

> WHAT THE HECK, MATIEU?!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

> What?

_Matieu shrugs like a cliche comic relief character._

> I'm trying to lighten the mood.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

> IS NOW THE TIME?!

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread rolls its eyes at the crew's antics, wanting to keep everyone's focus for its amusement._

> `Dread`: Kill this vessel. I have millions of florans to use.
> `Dread`: They are nothing to me!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Matieu leaves Iris and heads to Dread stupidly._

> Hey, what's up, fucker?
> Get out of my friend!

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

> What if I used a fire extinguisher?

_Garrick wink wonks._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Iris sighs and decides to entertain Garrick's joke question._

> And no, magic fire can’t be extinguished.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Garrick gives the widest, most devious smile he's ever made._

> What if I used TWO fire extinguishers?

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Chomsky throws another bath-bomb into Garrick's mouth to shut him up. Garrick decides to entertain this again._

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Garrick puffs up with more bubbles and attempts to speak._

> UBTT!
> DUST!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

> I'll annoy the shit out of you until you leave my friend!

_Matieu grabs at Dread's arm and tries to pull him away._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

> Sooooooo... I just have to...
> You know...

_Iris shakes her fireball, preparing to throw it at Sanya._

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick pull out two fire extinguishers and extinguish Iris' hand fire?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook not so good, RPretribution.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

_Garrick pulls out a fire extinguisher from his pockets and tries to extinguish Iris' hand fire to no success._

> Huh. Weird.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya pick up Kyle and throw him?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, Brakia.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

> CALM THE FUCK DOWNNNnN!

_Matieu latches himself onto Dread and tries to knock her over._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

> `Dread`: Leave us!

_`Dread`: Dread shakes her shoulder, slamming Matieu onto the dirt._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

_Chomsky gives Sanya a rather lazy plea, not having paid attention._

> Yo, Sanya can you chill?
> I don't know what's going on with you but it's deeply unsettling. Please stop...

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

_Garrick watches Kyle whizz by him and screams in surprise._

> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

> You think you can kill me, plant?

_Kyle stands up and dusts itself off, aiming his flamethrower at Dread._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread sighs, fed up with the crew not taking him seriously._

> `Dread`: You all have angered me. You can have this worm back. But remember. I am coming...

_`Dread`: Dread gives a devious smirk before leaving Sanya's body unconscious from his meddlings._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

> SUCK A DICKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

_Sanya falls to the ground as her flower turns from red to black._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

> Uh, Sanya?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

t!8ball does Iris wake Sanya up?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

🎱 | My sources say no, Jelsafan0.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

> Aye, now that she's gone...

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

> One more outburst like that and I'm killing the Floran. Got that?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

> Great, now she’s not trying to murder anyone.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

> I guess. She doesn't look okay, though.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Garrick looks at Sanya, disappointed and with a bit of uncharacteristic disgust._

> The Creator got lazy when he created Florans.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

> Yeah, now we should have some alone time Iris.

_Matieu gives her a wink wink and a nudge nudge._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Iris pauses in disgust._

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

> Hey, don't be a creep.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

> I'm not a creep.
> You're a creep.

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

> You kinda are.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

> I'm a strong man.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

> What the heck, Matieu...?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> You don't get to say what the heck.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> What heck?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> Why is it always me?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> I already said what I wanted to say.
> How am I gonna prove myself to you?

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> I'ma just point out he said that while surrounded by people.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> I'll go cut open my arteries again.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> Edgy.

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> Edgy fuck.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> That’s dangerous. Maybe don’t do that?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu cut open 8 of his arteries and sew them up within 16 seconds?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Matieu points to the eight separate wounds across his arms and smiles, like it's a party trick._

> See, it's fun!

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth step off Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

> Please, don’t do that.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

> Well, I'd never do it to you.
> I'd never hurt a woman.
> Especially if her name was Iris.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

> I’m pretty sure it’s bad for your health though.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

_Matieu shrugs._

> Everyone dies eventually.
> Just enjoy it.

**WatchfulDrake** _(04-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

> So it'll be a while...?

_Hector snarls, starting to get annoyed at his protégé._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth run over to the area and prove his worth?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook not so good, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

> Seth, how are you even alive?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Seth tilts his head up to reveal several hickeys and lipstick marks on his neck._

> Nepotism.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick wake Emmett up?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, RPretribution.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya awaken?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, definitely, Brakia.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

_Garrick pokes Emmett's snout repeatedly._

> Wake up, smelly.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

_Emmett's eyes slam open, bloodshot._

> Huh?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

> Good morning, Emmett!

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

t!8ball Do the people who just woke up do the fortnite dance really violently?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, definitely, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

> Bah!

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

> What jussst happened?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

_Iris looks flabbergasted at Sanya._

> Same to you, Sanya.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_Garrick's jaw drops to the floor when he sees Emmett doing a little jig._

> FORTNITE??????

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> Oh gods, not the 'bah' thing again.

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_Kyle talks to Emmett like a baby._

> Welcome back, little guy. Are you ready to crawl on Sanya some more?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> GOOD MORNING SQUOATOPIA AND FRIENDS!

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> You got possessed and I almost had to choke you with my ribbon to knock you out.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> Sanya, stop stinking up the place.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_Garrick squints at Sanya for a moment, smelling an awful scent from her flower._

> Sanya, this is weird. Even for you.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> What? I'm not doing anything...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> And I bullied the shit out of the god of dread or whatever it was.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> ...God of Dread?

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> Seth, shut up.
> You died in a flipping oven.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> Yeah.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> Yes, that's right.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> Oh no.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> Something like that.
> They were scared of me after it.
> I threatened to bully them until they let you go.

_Matieu tells a big fat lie to impress Iris._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> So Seth is back, I guess.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> No no no. Oh fuck no.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> Sanya?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Iris trembles briefly._

> He wasn’t scared of my fire. I wasn’t sure what to do.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> And now I got a contract that prevents me from dying, isn't that great?

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> What did he sssay?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> Mean things...

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> That’s great, Seth!

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

_Chomsky is completely unaware that Dread even existed, thinking Sanya was just going cuckoo this whole time._

> ...he?

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> Hehehe.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> He said he’d come back.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> But I told him to suck a dick.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

_Emmett stares at Seth, shocked._

> No.
> That just means you're like a fucking god.
> Which is terrible.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> It also makes me insane.

_Seth lights a spazz cigar._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> No, it meansss he'sss after you guysss now.

_Sanya looks down towards the earth, thinking of her dream and feeling dread._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> I don't give a fuck.
> He can kiss my ass.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> Uh, that's foreboding.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> Thiss iss bad, thiss iss sso bad.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> Great. I always wanted to be pursued by a literal god.

_Iris says this without any change in tone, making it unclear if she's sarcastic or not._

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

_Chomsky pauses for a moment, using 100% of his brainpower to think of a solution._

> Does he burn?

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> No, he doessn't burn. He'sss a god.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> Me too, Iris!

_Matieu daydreams about Kleux for a moment._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> I’m like the easiest person to kill, all you have to do is take off my necklace.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> Is he a ghostbuster?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> I'm interested in everything you're interested in.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> Also, occasionally I have to fuck my wife, the Goddess of Death, which will require me to die.

_Seth says this nonchalantly, like it's nothing._

> Anyways, I gotta go have sex now. Bye.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

_Garrick playfully wails as he flies away._

> Oh noooooₒₒₒₒₒₒₒₒₒ...

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> Wait... Did I hurt anyone?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> Wow. Got it. I promise I won’t cry.

_Iris grits her teeth, bearing through her shock and germinating trauma._

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> You almost got yourself killed.

_Kyle says this with a strong air of overconfidence._

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> Nah... I think I talked enough to make him not hurt anyone.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> So, am I always going to be a few inches smaller now?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> We’re all unharmed.

_Iris looks down at Emmett, who she towers over even more than before._

> You could always ask someone to stretch your spine, Emmett!

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

> Good. Now we can all call you shortie.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

_Translation: I will move to Mars and change my name to Galtero. He can't hurt me there._

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

_Sanya feels a chill down her spine._

> Ssomething feelss wrong. He wouldn't leave without getting ssomething he wanted.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

> Did he get a few inches off of me?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

_Iris compares her height with Sanya's to see if the Floran has grown any taller._

> No...

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

> Well, he wanted to kill you, I think.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

> I need to make ssure everythingss alriight. Doess anyone have a mirror?

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

t!8ball does Iris have a mirror?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

_Iris hands Sanya the mirror, not noticing the shaking of her hands._

> Here.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

_Sanya scrutinizes her reflection, noticing a change in her flower's pigment._

> My flower!

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

> Why is it black now?

_Chomsky grimaces, thinking he or Iris may have accidentally charred Sanya's head during the scuffle._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

t!8ball Does everything go back to normal and everyone makes up?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

🎱 | Don't count on it, Bagelwrecker.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

> It doessn't sssmell like vanilla anymore... It sssmells like sssulphur.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

> I’m gonna hazard a guess and say that’s bad.

**PlasmaPerson** _(04-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

> Umm, sulphur is very flammable.

_Chomsky steps away, feeling unusually self-aware of his destructive tendencies._

**ProfessorTree** _(04-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

t!8ball Does the episode stop?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

🎱 | My reply is no, ProfessorTree.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

t!8ball Does everyone make out instead?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, Zander.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Matieu looks over by chance towards the still-burning hut fire, and sees something within the forest..._

> AHHH, IT'S AN O.O.F.!!!
> That is, an ogre orgy fest.

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

_Emmett, feeling suddenly enchanted by the O.O.F., begins approaching the distressed Sanya with a kissy-kissy face._ 

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

_Sanya places one hand on Emmett's head and holds him away at arm's length._

> Don't touch me.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick feel anything?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

🎱 | Don't count on it, RPretribution.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

> Didn't know you were into kissing the freshly revived.

_Seth gives a hearty laugh like a dad, seeing the two bickering._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

_Emmett squeezes his face above Sanya's palm and pouts._

> Seth told me to make out with you.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

> Go away.

**RPretribution** _(04-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

_Garrick looks up from the bag of stale chips he's been munching on._

> What's going on?

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya walk away from the kissing orgy?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, Brakia.

**Jelsafan0** _(04-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

_Iris stands silent, baffled, and disgusted._

**Zander** _(04-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

_Emmett flails his arms ahead of him, trying to reach Sanya's chest._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett start making out with Maia?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

🎱 | Signs point to yes, Enchantingtable2013.

**Brakia** _(04-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

_Sanya, focusing on her current flower conundrum, pushes Emmett away and towards Iris._

> You guys have fun.
