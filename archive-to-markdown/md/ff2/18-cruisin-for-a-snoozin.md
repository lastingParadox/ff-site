ðŸŽ± | Ask again later, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

_Seth stretches out his body, his skin silky smooth, like a baby's._

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 03:27 PM)_

_Iris stares at Sanya curiously._

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

_Sanya coughs up some black substance and spits it up at the ground._

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 03:31 PM)_

_Sanya watches her trembling hands._

> I feel wrong...

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 03:31 PM)_

_Iris crouches down next to Sanya and holds her hands to keep them still._

t!8ball Does Seth suddenly start streaking and hops onto Iris's back?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_Iris jumps, startled from Seth hopping atop off her. She struggles to get him off of her._

> Get off me!

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

> What in Sam Hill?!

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_Iris violently jolts her shoulders back._

> What the heck?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_Seth holds his arms to the sky, somehow gyrating his hips whilst on Iris's back._

> YAH YEET!

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Jim holds out his arm and flexes his hand, making his way over to Iris._

> Hold on, lets see if we can get em' off!

> Hey.

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, MultiTheDuck.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

_Chomsky takes out his trademark pipe and blows bubbles out of it before pocketing it._

> "Yigga" means yes.

_Chomsky pushes up his glasses with his index finger._

> It's a very complicated term, I don't blame you if you didn't know.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

_Emmett snores softly, still asleep amidst this chaos._

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

> But why yell it and jump on someone?

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

_Chomsky shrugs._

> Beats me.
> He's crazy.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

> Why me?

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

> His brain has been screwed up ever since that fire...

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

_Still naked, Seth jumps around on the ground, flailing his arms about._

> Cheeki breeki brooki braaki!

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

_Jim clicks his teeth in disgust._

> Yea no, he is crazy.

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

_Sanya watches Seth in confusion._

> I have a few concernss about what'ss happening to Sseth...

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

> Is his translator broken or something?

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

_Seth stops jumping about and quickly flicks his head back to Sanya, giving her a serious glare._

> Yeah, whatever.

_Seth stands up._

> SO what if I'm insane?
> I can live from a gun shot to the head! Now eat my ass!

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

_Iris's face scrunches up._

> No thank you.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

_Chomsky smirks._

> I can test that theory.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

_Seth scoffs and holds out his hand._

> I can test it for you, hand me my pistol

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

> We almost lost him last time, let's try not to lose him again!

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris decide to ignore Seth?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Jelsafan0.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

> Alright.

_Chomsky hands Seth his desert eagle._

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 3, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

_Before Seth can do anything with the gun, Jim chops Seth's arm and catches the pistol._

> Yea no, not trusting you with a gun right now.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

_Seth rolls his eyes._

> Whatever.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

_Chomsky gives a wide troll face._

> Nah, I'm sure it would've been fine.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth snatch his gun back and shoot himself in the head?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Bagelwrecker.

> Good call, Jim.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett make soft goat noises in his sleep to alert the others?

t!8ball Does Sanya wake Emmett up?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

_Sanya, tired of Emmett's snores, shakes him rapidly._

> Hey, Emmett.
> Wake up.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

_Emmett opens his eyes, not entirely all there._

> Huh?

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

> Are you okay?

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_Iris smiles softly._

> Good morning.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

> Ah, the goat awakes.

_Chomsky gives a small wave._

> Morning sunshine.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_Hector folds one set of arms._

> You should have let him sleep, he needs to recover

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

> What, you think he's gonna grow just from sleeping?

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_Hector nudges Chomsky._

> His throat, not his height.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

> We need to get to a city.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

_Hector starts packing up his doctor's bag._

> Agreed.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

> Might see what we can do about these two.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

_Seth, as he's putting his clothes back on, scowls at the others' lack of interest._

> We are literally half a mile a way from my home town, retards.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

_Chomsky snaps his fingers._

> Ah, yes, an elf crawling out of ones throat does mess that up.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

_Emmett nods slowly._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

> Oh, back to town then?

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

_Sanya helps Emmett stand, propping him with her shoulder._

> We have to. We don't have a sship.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

_Seth furrows his brow and snarls._

> Well guess what, retard? I have a ship lot that we can go to and use one of the many ships I captured!

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

_Emmett glares at Seth._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

_Iris gets on her feet and heads to help Sanya keep Emmett upright before realizing she likely doesn't need the help._

> That was an unsavory way to word it.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

> How many crews have you taken down just to get their ship?

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

_Sanya exhales loudly._

> Then why haven't we done that before?

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

_Jim rolls his eyes and mutters._

> Probably just stole them while he fucked the crew.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

_Seth frowns at Jim._

> I got them when I was a Star Fleet captain within the Elven Military.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

_Chomsky's interest is peaked as he gets closer to Seth._

> The military, huh? What happened with that?

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

> Had sex.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

_Chomsky's smile fades slightly._

> I see.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

_Jim starts fiddling with his arm, grumbling nonsense to himself._

> Home alone 76...

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

> I had sex with a higher up's wife.

_Seth beams in his arrogance._

> Well worth it.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

> That's a little messed up...

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

> ... And you openly admit to that?

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

> Of course I do!

_Seth winks at Iris._

> It's already in the Elven military's records.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Iris pinches her forehead._

> ... What do they see in you?

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Emmett just rolls his eyes._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

> At least he's honest, I guess...

_Chomsky doesn't put much effort into a shrug._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

> They see what I want to show them.

_Seth gives a guttural laugh._

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

> Lets just get a ship before someone notices the smoke...

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

> Meh, they won't care.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew immediately go look for a town?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, PlasmaPerson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

> The fucking cabin housed a monster that ate children in my town.

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 03:59 PM)_

> I ssee...

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 03:59 PM)_

> Why specifically the children?

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 03:59 PM)_

> Hansel and Gretel of the universe!

_Jim laughs softly._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

> Because they didn't know much about the flora.

_Seth scoffs._

> They should have avoided the damn shrooms.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

> If anything happened like that on Earth, the place would have been gone a while ago...

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

> Well, we respect nature to an extent.

_Seth stares at the remains of the cabin._

> Also, monsters are hard to kill.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

_Emmett stares at the mushrooms with uncertainty._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

_Seth notices Emmett and snaps at him with concern._

> Don't.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

> You call what almost killed you nature?

_Jim spins his arm arrogantly._

> Thats called target practice, bud.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris kick a rock that bounces off a tree and hits her in the forehead?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

_Iris instinctly grabs her face from the impact of the rock._

> Ow.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

_Emmett raises an eyebrow at what Iris just did._

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

_Jim gives a dramatic sigh and yells._

> OK, CAN EVERYONE JUST PACK UP, AND LETS GO TO TOWN.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

t!8ball Do we walk to Seth's hometown?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Bagelwrecker.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

_Chomsky slaps his thigh._

> Welp, lead the way, elf!

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_Iris stifles her laughter._

> Which one?

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

> Me.

_Seth heads off in the direction of his hometown._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_Chomsky rolls his eyes._

> The one who is full elf...

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_Iris giggles at her own joke as no one else would._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

> No offense.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

> It was a joke!

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

> Ahh.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_As the group travels back to the kingdom, Jim calls up a buddy. His conversation is brief and quiet, however he speaks the following loud enough for the others to hear._

> I'd smash, end of discussion.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_Emmett checks his ears for any possible floran bites._

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

t!8ball Does the group find their way into town yet?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

> Looks like we're here.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett try to speak out of frustration?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

> Alright, I'm going to go up to my home, bye.

_Seth gives a peace sign to the others before he starts to head off to his parents'._

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Emmett attempts to speak, only able to wheeze out a whimper._

> Se-th!

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Seth spins around, his smirk fading._

> Yigga?

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

_Emmett coughs and whispers out._

> Get us a big ship...

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> Alright, don't strain yourself, goat.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> Gotcha.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_Jim puts a hand on Chomsky's shoulder as if to correct him._

> Squat. Not goat.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> It'll be as big as my penis inside your mom's vagina!

_Seth slaps his hands together and giggles._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> A big ship would be nice...

_Iris is unfazed by Seth's constant sexual humor._

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_Emmett sighs and coughs._

> Fuck me then...

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> Yeah, not that garbage ship that we had before.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_Seth gives Emmett a wink._

> No thanks.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> We could get that double decker, MK2, Galactica warfare.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_Seth points at Jim._

> No.

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya check on the rest of the crew?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

> We get another classic.

_Seth slaps his rear._

> Eat my ass.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

_Jim scoffs._

> Fuck classics, we need something good.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

_Iris pops up._

> What about the really big one my uncle always used to use when they went off planet?

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

> The last "classics" sucked and could barely fit anything.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sean follow up on his 8ball decision and make Seth actually lead the team to the place with ships?

_Seth rubs his hands together._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

> Erm... it was... this vintage cruise thing...

_Iris puts a finger to her chin, trying to remember her uncle's cruise ship._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

> Not those "classics", as you say.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Jim puts his index finger to his palm as he makes his point._

> That Galactica has space for twice as many people we have, and has storage we need.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

> I'm not good with ships.

_Iris shrugs._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Seth groans loudly._

> We don't need storages!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(08-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris light Emmett on fire?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Enchantingtable2013.

_Emmett wheezes._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris remember the name of the classic, excessively large ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Jelsafan0.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

_Seth folds his arms._

> Cell stupid, armory dumb!

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

_Sanya lets go of Emmett, who's able to hold himself upright._

> Why do we need cellss?

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

_Chomsky rolls his eyes and mutters._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

_Chomsky perks up and speaks in a mocking singsong tone._

> Whaat? Why not?
> We could have a bunch of cool weapons!

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

_Jim sighs._

> Not fucking military, its a self portable cruiser with light guns.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

_Emmett utters out, clearly ignoring the directive to keep his throat intact._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

> If you can't carry your own weapons, you can go back home.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

> Well guess what, I'm not planning on having twenty of us.

_Seth sticks out his tongue._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

_Chomsky raises an eyebrow._

> What is that screaming...?

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

> What about the vintage cruise my uncle used to use...?

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

**Enchantingtable2013** _(08-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Emmett mutters to Seth._

> Just take a ship from your garage.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Seth gently pushes Emmett away from himself._

> Well guess what, I don't have one!
> I only collect vintage pirate ships and vintage ships!

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | Bagelwrecker, You need to give at least 2 options.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Iris audibly groans._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

t!choose Vintage Blorpo Andromeda | Classic Mercedes Hoth | Vintage Goorpo Doono

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, TheBlade.

t!8ball Does Emmett take out a small bundle of grass and start to chew upon it?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

_Jim watches as Seth enters a ship. He looks about the ship, perturbed over the label on the exterior._

> The hell is a Blorpo?

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

_Sanya pats Emmett on the back, ignoring the bickering around her._

> I'm glad you're eating.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

_Iris straightens up at the sight of her ship._

> ... Is that the vintage cruise my uncle used to take?

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

_Emmett smiles softly towards Sanya._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_Seth waves his arms in the air in glory of the ship._

> Ah... The Andromeda. Nice leather seats in the cockpit, wood paneling inside, five baths, fifteen rooms, a large captain's quarters, three stories, an indoor pool. I got this from a famous drug lord.

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya check on Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Brakia.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> Ok, thats better than the MK2...

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Chomsky enters the ship from behind Seth, looking around._

> Oooh, nice ride. Smells a little though...

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Hector shrugs._

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Sanya looks down at Emmett, swiveling his head around by his chin._

> Iss anything elsse wrong with you, bessidess your voice?

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> I had to sell some space weed for it.
> Don't mind it.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> What's its hull made of?

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Iris claps her hands happily._

> Oh! That's the one my uncle used to take!

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Emmett shrugs his shoulders and frowns as Sanya looks him over._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(08-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Matieu stares daggers into Seth._

> Did you sell MY space weed?

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Jim knocks on a wall to hear any reverberation._

> Is it strong?

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> It's the ultimate cruise ship.
> It's got bullet proofing on it.

_Seth punches a wall with full force. He takes his hand back and lodges his index finger back into place._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew completely go on board to check around?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, PlasmaPerson.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(08-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

_Matieu sighs, entering a state of self-reflection._

> I probaby have issues.
> Time to go sober.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> I got attacked several times while flying it.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

_Chomsky looks out the doorway._

> Nice ship, but does it fly? Looks a little old...

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

_Sanya takes her hand off of Emmett and backs up from him to get a better look._

> Hmm. Are you feeling alright physsically?

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

_Iris smiles widely._

> Which makes sense. My uncle only liked the best.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> It works, the mechanic keeps the ships in top notch condition.

_Seth snaps in the air to try and get the mechanic's attention._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> Who's the mechanic...?

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> Oh hey Gruffy.

_`Gruffy`: The mechanic walks up to the ship at Seth's request._

> `Gruffy`: Hey Seth, ya' takin' the Andromeda?

> Yep.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

_Chomsky puts his hand behind his head to look cool, but only gives off an awkward aura._

> 'Sup, uh, Gruffy...

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> `Gruffy`: Let me make some adjustments to the engine real quick.

_`Gruffy`: Gruffy takes out a pocket ladder that extends both upwards and horizontally to be able to work on the cruise ship's engine._

> Of course.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

_Emmett stretches a little bit to show that he is fine physically._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> That's Gruffy the Mechanic, He's one of the best mechanics for classics and vintages.

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> Alright...

_Sanya sticks near Emmett and moves her attention to the crew's new ship._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

> I prefer the newer models, but this'll do.

_Chomsky taps the ship._

> Yeah, this'll do.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

> Looks great.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

> Might need to put some guns on it though...

_Seth scowls._

> I had to take them off due to Elven laws.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

> You have some extra?

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

_Jim rolls his eyes._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

> Pfft. Never stopped Uncle Karian.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

_Emmett admires the girth of the ship, walking along its length with Sanya._

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

> That'ss a BIG sship!

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

_Iris laughs to herself._

> It looks just like Uncle's!

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

> I like the layout, not the color though...

_Hector is sickened by the metallic red color of the cruise ship._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

> Only, uncle's had a huge cannon on the top. And it was white...

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Seth shrugs._

> Meh, we can paint over it.

t!8ball Does Gruffy fix up the engine?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Jim peers over at Gruffy, who is wrapping up his maintenance._

> Hey Gruffy, you got something we can use to re-color the ship?

t!8ball Does Gruffy say yes?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, TheBlade.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

_`Gruffy`: Gruffy thinks for a moment and shakes his head as he descends his ladder._

> `Gruffy`: Not currently

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett hop into the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

> `Gruffy`: I done ran out yesterday.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

_Jim scoffs._

> Hmm, sham.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

> Well, it could be worse...

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

_Emmett nods approvingly at the ship's interior, having snuck in behind the others._

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

_Jim looks around the garage from the interior of the ship for Emmett._

> Hey, where did Emmett go?

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

> Don't worry about it, we can fix it at the next space station.

_Seth sits down on a seat along the hatch wall._

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

_Jim shakes his head._

> Its like looking after a child all over again...

_Jim looks at the others, who have mixed expressions of confusion._

> Don't ask.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does the whole crew follow Emmett inside the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, MultiTheDuck.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

> Where did he go?

_Hector looks about himself._

> I just saw him.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

_Seth, clearly not worried over Emmett's whereabouts, continues to gloat._

> I kinda overclocked the engine so it should go really fast. I had to escape the police a lot.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

> I like it, Seth.

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya enter the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Brakia.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

_Emmett takes out a bottle of squodka harvested from the Polonot and sips it while lounging in the cockpit._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

_Chomsky is able to make out the sound of Emmett's hoofs klinking against the pilot's console._

> Goatman is on the ship.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

_Hector raises a Martian eyebrow._

> How do you know, human?

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

t!8ball Does ANYONE go in the ship except for Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, PlasmaPerson.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:36 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris fully enter the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:36 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Jelsafan0.

t!8ball Does Matieu enter the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:36 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Cannot predict now, Enchantingtable2013.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:36 PM)_

> Also I don't think I've properly introduced myself to most of you.

_Hector puts two of his six hands on his chest._

> My name is Hector.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:36 PM)_

_Emmett shifts his hooves and manages to lock the entrance to the cockpit._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:36 PM)_

_Iris looks up in awe at the ship's interior, partially tearing up._

> ... Wow, brings back... A lot of memories.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

> And you say this now?

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth leave the hatch to enter the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Bagelwrecker.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

_Hector shrugs._

> Since we have a moment, why not?

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

_Seth attempts to enter the cockpit but realizes it's locked. He peers through the door's window to see Emmett._

> Emmett, let me in.
> I got the keys.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

> And I'd rather not just call people by their races...

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

_Iris is standing in the hallway, staring blankly into the ship, lost in memories._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:38 PM)_

_Chomsky gives a devilish grin._

> Why not, Martian?

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:38 PM)_

> Some people from some planets take that the wrong way...

_Hector glares at Chomsky in disgust._

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:38 PM)_

t!8ball Does Jim start searching various rooms in the ship for the crew quarters?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, TheBlade.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:38 PM)_

_Chomsky straightens his posture and over-emphasizes his words to be annoying._

> Well, I'm Chomsky. But you can call me whatever.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:38 PM)_

_Jim pivots to Seth, grinning._

> So uh, you said something about a pool?

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

_Seth points in the direction of the pool._

> Yeah, It's empty though.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

_Hector puts a hand to his chin._

> I like that name. What part of Earth is it from?

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

_Chomsky shrugs._

> Not from earth.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

_Emmett closes his eyes, learning back further in the comfy captain's chair._

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

_Jim's eyes light up with stars._

> Does it happen to have a see through bottom, where you can see space through the water?

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

> I told Gruffy to keep it empty so we didn't have to clean it later.

_Seth puts out his hands, not knowing the answer._

> It might.
> It's been a while...

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett start to doze off?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

_Iris pokes her head into the room Seth and Jim are in._

> I believe it does, actually.
> I... could be wrong, though.

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya finally enter the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Brakia.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

t!8ball Do the remaining crew members also enter the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, MultiTheDuck.

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

_Sanya walks through the ship almost militantly, calculating the value of the interior's functionality._

> Hmm...

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

_Emmett unlocks the cockpit finally._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

_Iris is startled from the sound of the cockpit door opening and remains quiet._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

t!8ball Does Chomsky flop into the copilot seat?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, PlasmaPerson.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:42 PM)_

> Nice, seems comfortable... But I'm not sure how long that will last.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:42 PM)_

> Hmmm, I need to fix up the cockpit I guess...

_Seth enters the cockpit, noticing dust piling up along the walls._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:42 PM)_

> Guess I should... go join the others, huh?

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:43 PM)_

> Iris, we're right here.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:43 PM)_

_Iris expertly navigates her way to the cockpit just a few feet away and enters._

> ... Hey.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:45 PM)_

_Emmett peers at Iris from the back of the pilot's chair._

> Hey.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:45 PM)_

t!8ball Do the memories make Iris really sad?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:45 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Jelsafan0.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:46 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth start up the ship and launch?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

_Emmett continues to rest his hooves on the ship's console, considering that he's in the captain's seat, not Seth._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

_Chomsky points at Iris and Emmett._

> You guys don't look so good...

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

_Seth sighs and shakes the captain's seat._

> Get the fuck up Emmett before I beat your ass.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

_Iris frowns and tears up._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

> Don't make me get the belt...

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

_Emmett sticks up a middle digit to his father._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

> ... It's nothing. I just...

_Iris sniffles._

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:48 PM)_

> Should we be worried that no one closed the doors?

> Or...?

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:48 PM)_

> I miss him...

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:48 PM)_

> Probably.

_Hector closes the ship's hatch._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:48 PM)_

> My uncle, I mean.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:48 PM)_

_Chomsky took to Iris's side to try and comfort her._

> This place reminds you of him that much, huh?

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

> Considering that he had anyone else who used it beheaded? Yes...

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

_Chomsky pulls out a family photo and shows it to Iris._

> Consider yourself lucky. At least you get good memories.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth "pust" Emmett out the way to get the controls?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, TheBlade.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

> ... Not... not always...

_Iris sobs softly._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

> Get pusted!

_Seth slaps his rear in dominance._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

> Oh..
> What was he like? Your uncle?

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

_Emmett winces from being pushed to the hard ship floor. He manages to look into his satchel and shows Chomsky and Iris a picture of his parents._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:51 PM)_

_Seth, irritated with Emmett, decides to be an asshole._

> I killed that!

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:51 PM)_

_Jim peers at the photograph from a distance and smirks._

> I'd fuck it.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:51 PM)_

_Chomsky gives Emmett a smile._

> Heh, you look just like them.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:52 PM)_

> But smaller.... And skinnier... And less furrier...

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:52 PM)_

_Emmett points at Seth angrily and mimics slashing his neck due to his previous statement._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:52 PM)_

> He was nice sometimes, stern others. He didn't have a whole lot of time for me, being busy ruling the planet and all, but...

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:52 PM)_

_Seth rolls his eyes and sits in the captain's seat._

> Go ahead, try.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:53 PM)_

> Ruling an entire planet? Sounds important.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:53 PM)_

> When he was around, we had fun.

_Iris shrugs._

> I mean, yeah. Being king of the light elves is a really important profession.
> But don't get me wrong- he wasn't perfect.
> Not by a long shot.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:54 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett try to kick Seth out of his seat and start the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:54 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Zander.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:54 PM)_

> No one is, I suppose.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:55 PM)_

_Jim shifts his feet, having been leaning on the wall of the cockpit this whole time._

> You know, some lady tried that back in the 8500's on Earth.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:55 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:55 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 4, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:55 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 04:55 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 5, Zander.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:55 PM)_

_Emmett puts all of his might into getting Seth out of the captain's seat and manages to push him aside. He musters out the following._

> You're such a fatass...

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:56 PM)_

> Look man, I can't have you pilot while you're mute.

_Seth stands and exhales._

> It's a little dangerous when I can hardly hear what you say.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:56 PM)_

> How does that help with flying a ship?

_Jim puts his hands on his hips._

> Wait, why are we letting you fly, you tried shooting yourslef a few minutes ago.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

> He didn't like me all that much. I could tell. I mean, he tried to ignore that I wasn't just a regular elf, but... he wasn't very good at it. He never invited my father to anything. He got me things like colored contacts, and hair dye.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

> Because, I'm the next best thing to Emmett.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

> Not even I'm perfect. Believe it or not.

_Chomsky gives a cocky smile._

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

> True...

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

> He can probably still fly.

_Jim leans in to get Emmett's expression._

> Right emmett?

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

_Iris snickers at Chomsky's joke._

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

_Hector enters the cockpit._

> I think we need to link my and Matieu's comms to your groups comms.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

_Emmett shrugs and nods._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:58 PM)_

> He can, doesn't change the fact it wouldn't be the safest thing ever though.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 04:58 PM)_

_Iris utters out a playfully sarcastic response._

> I never would've guessed.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:58 PM)_

> Emmett can't really do callouts all that well right now.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 04:58 PM)_

> Well, when we do eventualy leave, where to?
> Can we actually have a plan for once?

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:58 PM)_

_Chomsky chuckles in return._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:58 PM)_

_Seth snaps, as if a lightbulb has just went off._

> Space Station S-19.
> We'll get our ship repainted and then get a mission.
> Plus I know a guy there.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

_Emmett coughs and speaks hoarsely._

> Hope my voice is fixed by then...

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

> I hope so too.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

_Chomsky's chuckle transitions into a sigh as he remembers why he mentions his imperfection._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

_Iris tilts her head in concern._

> Are... you okay?

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

> Don't worry, it should fixed by then.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

_Chomsky frowns._

> Yeah... My childhood was... Rough, to say the least.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

> We'll be meeting the guy that gave me this ship.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

_Iris puts a hand on Chomsky's shoulder._

> Do you... want to talk about it?

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 05:01 PM)_

> Though, his daughter won't be really happy to see me.

_Seth laughs heartily._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:01 PM)_

> My parents were nice and all, but...

_Chomsky shakes his head._

> No. Now isn't the time, I think.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 05:01 PM)_

_Hector pushes past everyone else and taps Seth's shoulder._

> Do you know where I could link my and Matieu's comms to your crews? I personally intend to stay around here.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:01 PM)_

_Emmett sits in the co-pilot's seat and takes out one of his dad's books from his satchel._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

_Seth gives Hector an unhelpful mix of head shakes and head nods._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

_Chomsky gives an strained exhale._

> I'd need more privacy and trust to talk about it. Not that I don't trust you, it's just that all of this is so new and I've only been here a couple weeks.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

> That's fine. I get it. There are things I don't like talking about either.
> But... if you ever need someone to talk to... I'll be around.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:03 PM)_

> I'll keep that in mind. Same for you, too.

_Chomsky stands up from the feelings pile the two ended up sitting in._

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:03 PM)_

_Emmett takes off his translator and shows how his communicator was attached to it. He then shows the frequency Hector would need to tune to._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:03 PM)_

> Alright.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

> Well, enough grieving. Space awaits!

_Chomsky raises his hand to the sky._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth start up the ship and launch now?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Bagelwrecker.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

t!8ball Does a white van appear in one of the rooms randomly?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, MultiTheDuck.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

_Chomsky holds out a hand to help Iris up._

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

_Jim cranes over and peers into the hallway._

> Did anyone else hear a thud?

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

_Chomsky tips his sunglasses._

> M'lady.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

_Emmett finishes up his whole bottle of squodka._

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

> I did, we should probably go check on it...

_Hector heads in the direction of the thud._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

> That's the escape pod.
> Don't worry about it.

_Seth turns on the massage function on the captain's seat._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

> Why, thank you!

_Iris giggles, takes Chomsky's hand, and stands._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

> Wlright... What's everyone else up to?

_Chomsky looks around._

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

_Hector stops at the white van, confused by Seth's statement._

> What?

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya find a room to stay in?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Brakia.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

> No idea. Shall we find out?

_Before Iris knew it, Chomsky has already left her to entertain Emmett._

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

_Out of boredom, Emmett shows Chomsky his father's book: "Arisen by Squoat!"_

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

_Iris runs out into the hall to look for the crew quarters._

> Fourth largest room is mine!

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

> What's this?

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

_Sanya finds a room and drops off her bags she scrounged from the Polonot ruins. She lies back on one of two twin beds in the room and exhales, relaxing temporarily._

> Thiss room iss good enough...

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

_Iris peers into Sanya's new room and giggles._

> That's the room I always used to stay in.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

> Oh I remember that book, good book, was kinda weird though...

_Seth flares his teeth._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:08 PM)_

> What's it about?

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

_Emmett moves his arms and bites to imitate a rabid zombie._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

t!8ball Does Chomsky open the book and read the first little bit?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, PlasmaPerson.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris head to the fourth largest room?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Jelsafan0.

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

_Chomsky opens up the book and flips it around, having opened it the wrong way._

> A zombie book?

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

_Emmett nods._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:10 PM)_

_Chomsky looks up at Emmett._

> Mind if I take this to read? I'm a fan of apocalypse novels.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

_Emmett coughs._

> It's based on a true story, but okay...

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

> I... think I'll just go explore...

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

_Chomsky raises an eyebrow._

> Wait, what? This actually happened?

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

> Of course it did.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

_Emmett continues to nod._

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

> Emmett is the scapegoat!

_Seth nudges an unamused Emmett with his elbow._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

> I, uh, look forward to finding out how...

_Chomsky frowns confusedly._

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:12 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett show Chomsky the bite scar on his left ear?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 05:13 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth eat some brownies?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 05:13 PM)_

> His father sucked out the infection.

_Jim smirks to himself, thinking a disgustingly erotic thought._

**PlasmaPerson** _(08-Sep-18 05:14 PM)_

> Chomsky finds a room and starts reading the book

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 05:14 PM)_

t!8ball Does Jim get a room and start modifying the door for safety?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 05:15 PM)_

_Jim just finds a room, but doesnt fix the door._

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:17 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett hook up the Hypernet router into the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:17 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Zander.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 05:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does hector find a room and start setting up his chemical supplies?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, MultiTheDuck.

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya explore the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Brakia.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris head into the kitchen to bake?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

t!choose Blueberry muffins | Blueberry cake | Blueberry bread | Blueberry pancakes | Blueberry croissant

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | Jelsafan0, I pick Blueberry croissant!

**Bagelwrecker** _(08-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth go to the Captain's Quarters and Go to bed?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

_After wandering through the ship corridors for a bit, Sanya finds Iris in the kitchen once again._

> Oh, hello Iriss.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

> Oh! Hey Sanya!

_Iris holds out a pan with two oven mitts._

> I made croissants!
> They... weren't supposed to be blueberry... but they turned out that way anyways!

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

_Sanya tilts her head._

> What'ss a croisssant?

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

> Wanna try one and find out?

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

> I guesss...

_Sanya grabs a croissant and pops it in her mouth._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:27 PM)_

> What do you think?

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:28 PM)_

t!8ball Is Emmett's voice fixed?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:28 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Zander.

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:28 PM)_

> I'm not ssure... it'ss very... different.

_Sanya shudders a bit._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:28 PM)_

> Hmm...

_Iris tries a croissant._

> It... tastes okay to me...

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:29 PM)_

> I've never had anything that didn't have meat before.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:29 PM)_

_The crew hears a staticy message over their comms: "A run-about.... I'LL STEAL IT! NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW!"_

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:29 PM)_

> Maybe one or two thingss, but nothing big.

_Sanya shrugs._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:29 PM)_

> Ah, that makes sense.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:30 PM)_

_Emmett swaggers his way to the kitchen._

> Wassup', ladies?

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:30 PM)_

> I like to bake, a lot.

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:31 PM)_

> Hey, your voice iss back.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:31 PM)_

> Oh, hello Emmett! Would you like a croissant?

_Iris holds out a croissant to Emmett._

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:31 PM)_

_Emmett starts banging on his translator for a moment before looking back towards them._

> What's a croissant?

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:31 PM)_

> Also, Sanya, would you like to bake with me sometime?

_Iris shakes the treat._

> Want to try one and find out?

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:32 PM)_

_Sanya shakes her head._

> I don't like heat, or anything to do with flame.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 05:32 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector smell the baked goods and join the others?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:32 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, MultiTheDuck.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:32 PM)_

> You think it would taste good with grass?

_Emmett takes out a bundle like an addict._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:32 PM)_

> You don't have to get near the oven. I can do that part.

_Iris's face scrunches up at Emmett's suggestion._

> Hmmm... probably not?

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:32 PM)_

> Maybe.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:33 PM)_

_Iris holds Sanya's hands._

> I'd just really like to spend more quality time with you. I feel like we should talk more, you know?

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 05:33 PM)_

_Hector pokes his head into the kitchen._

> Whats that smell?

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:33 PM)_

_Emmett takes a croissant and tries it._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:33 PM)_

> Oh! Hello! I made blueberry croissants! Want one?

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:33 PM)_

> Hello, Hector.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:33 PM)_

> Hey, this tastes...

_Emmett smacks his lips a bit, taking in the taste._

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

> Sure, haven't had one in a long time...

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

> And Iriss, I feel like we sshould talk more.

_Sanya smiles._

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

> ... Not like pink fruit.

_Emmett closes his eyes, savoring the taste._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

_Iris hands one over to Hector._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

> Agreed, haha. You're really fun to hang out with.

_Iris giggles._

> What do you think?

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:35 PM)_

_Emmett stuffs three in his mouth at once._

> Mmmh mgh!

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 05:36 PM)_

_Hector eats the croissant and gets a far away look on his face._

> Reminds me of the time I went to Earth.
> Great food, annoying people.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:37 PM)_

_Emmett, through a full mouth, winks over at Sanya._

> Hhh Sanyh, thahks fuhr earliher!

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:37 PM)_

> So I take it you like it, then?

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:38 PM)_

> Yhs!

**Brakia** _(08-Sep-18 05:38 PM)_

> You're welcome.

**Zander** _(08-Sep-18 05:38 PM)_

_Emmett swallows._

> Thanks for checking up on me.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 05:38 PM)_

> It's not bad...

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:40 PM)_

> I'm glad you like it. I think I'll go back to my old room.

_Iris heads out the kitchen after cleaning up._

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:41 PM)_

t!8ball Does everyone head to their room and the episode ends?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:41 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Jelsafan0.

**WatchfulDrake** _(08-Sep-18 05:43 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector start messing with his chemicals before a loud bang echos through out the ship, ending the episode?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:43 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, MultiTheDuck.

**Jelsafan0** _(08-Sep-18 05:44 PM)_

t!8ballDoes Iris head back into her old room and lay down, and a map slips out of her pocket with coordinates to a planet on it, ending the episode?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 05:44 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Jelsafan0.

**TheBlade** _(08-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

t!8ball Is there a giant Ketchup stain on it?

**Tatsumaki** _(08-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, TheBlade.
