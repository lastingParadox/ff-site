_Hector looks around the ground, finding his handgun._

> Oh there it is. I need to find whoever shot my ship.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:26 PM)_

> Stomach acid is incredibly deadly, unless drunk doused in alcohol, preferably whiskey.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:26 PM)_

> Elvish stuff isn't that deadly, only the creatures that want to kill you are.

_Seth looks about him, the forest appearing more dense than the day prior._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:27 PM)_

> I have a feeling walking might not be safe...

_Emmett gets up from his seat and stretches a bit._

_Kyle blares aloud the moment Iris detaches him from his charging station._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:27 PM)_

_Emmett beamed the moment Sanya arrived in the cockpit._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:27 PM)_

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 02:27 PM)_

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:27 PM)_

_Jim doesn't realize that the ship was in ruin._

> Someone get the navigation system online.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:27 PM)_

_Kyle's lights on his head start to flash frequently._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:27 PM)_

> We did, in fact, crash. What planet are we on again?

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:28 PM)_

> I'll check out the outside...

_Jim taps his bionic eye and scans the surrounding area._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:28 PM)_

> Could you get me a bucket with water in it? Sorry to bother you!

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:28 PM)_

> Acquiring location...

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 02:28 PM)_

_Sanya heads over to the kitchen sink, which was still functional due to the ship's resevoir still being intact._

> Isss water from the sssink ok?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:28 PM)_

> I think so.

_Emmett watches Sanya start up the sink from the cockpit._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:28 PM)_

> Emmett, fix up the navigation system, here is an empty can and a thing of copper wire.

_Seth shoves an empty soda can and a spool of copper wire to Emmett._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:28 PM)_

> What do you mean, you think so?

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 02:28 PM)_

> Alright. I'll get on that.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:28 PM)_

> We might have good water if the tank didnt crack.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:28 PM)_

_KYL300's flash a light green before reverting to their standard shades of cyan._

> Reboot successful.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:29 PM)_

> Also here's some Buct Tape.

_Seth gives some tape to Emmett as well._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:29 PM)_

_Emmett's brow furrows._

> Stop giving me shit.

_Emmett sighs and heads to the navigation console to check it out._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:29 PM)_

> Who is good with engineering? we need that Navigation system up.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:29 PM)_

> Jeez, what happened?

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

_Seth smirks and folds his arms confidently._

> Emmett is.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

> Why would anyone need Buct Tape in this situation...?

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

_Jim tries to open the door to his room, the locking mechanism lacking power to open._

> Also, someone help me with the door, it wont budge.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

> We crashed. I have no idea where we are...

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth help Jim open the door?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Bagelwrecker.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

> Huh...

_Kyle continues his scan._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

_Emmett opens up the navigation console's hatch and sticks his head in. He turns on the light from his comms watch, seeing dust and oxidation from age._

> Ugh. This system is so dusty.
> And rusty.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:31 PM)_

t!8ball Does Kyle help Jim open the door?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 02:31 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, ProfessorTree.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:31 PM)_

> Here, I'll help.

_KYL300 heads over to Jim and helps him pull open the door._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:31 PM)_

> Ah, thanks.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:31 PM)_

> Oh there's my stash of condoms.

_Seth crouches down and sticks his hand into the console while Emmett's looking in it._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:31 PM)_

_Iris frowns, uncomfortable with this newfound information._

> Why would you keep it in the navigation system?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:31 PM)_

> Half of them are used...

_Emmett gags while Seth grabs his condom stash._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

> Yeah, I forgot about them.

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

_Sanya heads back to the cockpit with a filled plastic bucket of water._

> I got the water. Where do you want it?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

> On my feet.

_Emmett shakes his backhooves, the acid from the crocodile still on them. Sanya sighs and begrudingly pours the water on his sullied hooves._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

> I want to know where we are. Can we not just... go outside the wreckage?

_Iris looks outward, seeing murky, muddy water surrounding the wreckage._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:33 PM)_

t!8ball Does the water and acid combination start to bubble up?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 02:33 PM)_

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:33 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:33 PM)_

_To keep Iris in the dark, Seth decides not to answer her._

_Seth raises his head and laughs._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:34 PM)_

_Kyle turns to Seth._

> Where are we, Seth?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:34 PM)_

_Emmett kicks his hooves up from the cool mix._

> Now I can fix this hunk of junk...

_Emmett finds that the main power coils are severed from the crash._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:35 PM)_

_Seth shrugs and takes out his watch, nabbing the general direction of the castle they were at the day prior._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:35 PM)_

_Iris bigs a small hole in the mud and finally places the crocodile corpse within it._

_Kyle beeps._

_Emmett manages to take some of the copper wire Seth handed him and attaches it to the power coil with the Buct Tape. The console lights up dimly from the weaker conductor being attached._

> Ah!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:37 PM)_

_Before Iris leaves, she thinks for a bit and holds her arm, not wanting to possibly be hurt from the crocodile._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:40 PM)_

_Jim cocks his handgun threateningly._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:40 PM)_

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:40 PM)_

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:42 PM)_

_Iris approaches the crocodile, petting it and speaking in a soft voice. It becomes attached to her quickly._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:42 PM)_

_Emmett tears apart the soda can to use it in the coil, attempting to get a better connection for the navs system to function._

_Iris giggles happily._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:42 PM)_

_As Seth enters the swamp waters, his legs get scratched up by brambles. He winces for a second before continuing onward._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:42 PM)_

> Really? There are some suplies in the storage...

_Jim looks away._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:42 PM)_

> That's good. Crocodilians can be dangerous when aggressive.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:43 PM)_

> I think at least, before I made that cage in there.

_Jim shrugs._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:43 PM)_

> Yes. Animals love me.
> ... where am I going to put... Raven?

_Iris hugs her elven crocodile tightly._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

_Emmett stops messing with the console and takes his head out, taking a short break._

> Please get me those, Jim.

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

> Did you name her already?

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

t!8ball Does Kyle search for any GPS signals?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, ProfessorTree.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

> Yes.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

> I'll go look for the wires and suplies.

_Jim walks off to see if the ship has any supplies to help with Emmett's maintenance._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

> Her name is Raven and she is mine!

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

_Sanya looks up and down the crocodile, inspecting it thoroughly._

> Alssso, I think that'sss a male.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

_Iris pauses, looks at Raven, and raises an eyebrow._

> Weâ€™ll check in a minute.

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

> How about Crow inssstead of Raven?

_Sanya shrugs._

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 9, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

_Jim steps into the swamp water when accessing the other parts of the ship, managing to stab his leg into an Elven spike trap in the water. Jim groans and pulls his leg out in horror. He heads to the medbay to get himself patched up._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

> Seth's skull is so thick sometimes...

_Emmett sighs._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

> For now, letâ€™s just figure out where to put the crocodile.

_Iris holds Raven like a baby._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

_Jim comes back after finding some supplies and patching up his leg._

> I only found some of these wires, nothing much...

_Jim sets the wires down and takes out a screw._

> Also, this wierd looking screw.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

> I may have some extra supplies that could help...

_Hector starts digging around his pack._

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

> We have a cage, but it'sss a bit cramped.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

> ... Iâ€™ll just...
> Keep her in my bed.

_Iris kisses Raven affectionately._

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

> I guesss that could work.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

> Oh! That screw is used for this component I think. Seth unscrewed it to put some girl's underwear inside.

_Emmett grabs the screw and gets it situated in another broken commponent in the navigation console._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:48 PM)_

> Emmett, what do you think of these supplies? You think its enough to fix the nav system?

_Jim watches as Emmett does his magic._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:48 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett fix the ship without much issue?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 02:48 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:48 PM)_

> Hey, it fixed the system that time though, didn't it?

_Emmett takes himself out of the console's maintainence hatch and turns it on, the console beaming with electricity and rebooting without issue._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:48 PM)_

> Yeah.

_Emmett crosses his arms judgmentally._

> Your panty fetish has got to stop.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:49 PM)_

> Look, I only keep them to sell them.

_Seth shrugs._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:49 PM)_

> I love animals. Especially birds. On my home planet, I had three of them.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 02:49 PM)_

> That's unhealthy and quite gross

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:50 PM)_

> Thanks, Jim.

_Emmett gives Jim a smile._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:51 PM)_

> Two of them were caught, and the third was their baby.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:51 PM)_

> No problem.

_Jim looks around the swamp._

> Where are we again?

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 02:51 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector check his bag to make sure he still has all his supplies?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 02:51 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, MultiTheDuck.

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya study the plants in the swamp?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Brakia.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

t!8ball is the crocodile a girl?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Jelsafan0.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

_Hector takes out his rifle and inspects it after searching through his bag._

> Looks like I've got everything still, I'll need to repair my rifle though, my stock is misaligned...

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

_Iris inspects Raven's underside, checking whether the crocodile was a female._

> Hah! Raven is a girl.

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

> You appear to be right.

_Sanya looks uninterested._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth arrive at his home town, having left the others?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

> Ahhh, home sweet home...

_Seth opens up the doors to his father's castle._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

> Alright. Do you want to go find civilization?

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

> I want to check out thessse flowersss...

_Sanya trudges through some mud to reach some plants._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

> We're on Seth's homeplanet.

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

> I haven't ssseen thessse before...

_Sanya pricks her finger on a thorn in interest._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

> Alright. I should go find the ship.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

> Wait, what? Get the comms up, we need to tell the others!

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

> He told me that it's like controlled by gods or something...

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

> I'm gonna head to the church, I got some taxes to pay.

_Seth, having just entered his father's castle, decides to leave for the church._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

> Or... maybe to town?

_Iris looks around for civilization nearby._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

> So much for gods' world, its literaly a swamp here.
> Or at least this area.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

> Town. Iâ€™ll go to town.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

_Hector stares into Emmett's soul._

> Squoatling, what is this planet's name?

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

> Which way was town again?

_Iris scratches her head, having moved Raven about her shoulders._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

_KYL300 connects to Seth's watch through his communications system._

> I'll meet you there, Seth. I've pinpointed your coordinates...

_Kyle turns his body in the direction of where Seth went._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

> Iâ€™ll just go find the others.
> Iâ€™ll shout really loud.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

> I think our ship is boned though. Look.

_Emmett points to the window. In it, quicksand is rising up the sides of the ship wreckage._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

_Iris cups her hands around her mouth._

> MARCO!

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

> ... We need to get out of here...

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

_KYL300 repeats back to Iris loudly._

> POLO!

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

> The ship is sinking!

_Jim races out of the cockpit._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

> Alright, sounds good, might want to dress as an elf though, Elves don't appreciate robots unfortunately...

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

_Iris heads in the direction of Kyle's voice._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

> Hector, this is Lama'entria.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

> MARCO!

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

> POLO!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

_Iris continues towards the ship, getting closer._

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

> Thisss flower ssseemsss... ssstrange...

_Sanya taps it delicately._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

> MARCO!

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

t!choose Go towards Iris | Go towards Seth | Wait for Iris

> POLO!!

_Kyle leaves the ship, heading towards the kingdom Seth's in._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

> MARCO!

_Seth chuckles._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

_Iris panics a bit but follows the robot's voice, speeding up._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

> Guys, our ship is a goner!

_Emmett panics a bit, looking for something he should grab before it's lost._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

> MAAARRRCOOO!!!

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | TheBlade, I pick Water!

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

> Ill get some water out before this ship goes under.

_Jim heads to the engine room to grab the some barrels for the water resevoir._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 02:59 PM)_

_Iris is getting closer, considering her speed._

> MARCO!!

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 02:59 PM)_

> POLO!!

_Kyle is pretty far from the shipwreck at this point._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

t!8ball Does Jim get all the water outside he can?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, TheBlade.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

> Just a little bit more!

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett grab his plasma crossbow before trying to pry open the ship door?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Ask again later, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

> MARCOOOO!!!

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett grab his plasma crossbow before escaping the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

> Hey, pick up our family photos!

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

> POLOOOO!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

_Iris pants frantically, having made it back to KYL300._

> Hi...! Iâ€™m... Here!

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

> I have those in my satchel, Seth.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

> CROCK!

_Jim rushes over to Iris and squeezes her and Raven tightly._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector grab something important looking then leave the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, MultiTheDuck.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

> Oh, good.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

> Hey. We're almost to Seth...

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

> That means my porn mags are also in there!

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

> Along with the crew's credit.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

> Why is it sinking so fast?

_Hector watches as the swamp's maw eats up the ship._

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya grab a handful of plants to bring back and study?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

_Sanya pulls out some of the plants and sticks them into a backpack she found on the ship._

> I want to take a better look at thessse later. But now I need to head back to the crew.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

t!8ball Are all of Irisâ€™ belongings conveniently on her?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | Jelsafan0, I pick Iris has her ribbons!

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

> Wait, where am I?

_Sanya looks around, lost. She happened to be completely forgotten by Iris._

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

> Guysss?

_Sanya looks around her, alone. She frowns and is a little paranoid of having to navigate the swamp alone._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

t!8ball does everyone in the crew escape with all their belongings?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 3, Zander.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

_The barbs in the swampbed finally get to Emmett as well, scraping some chips out of his backhooves as he walks by them._

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

> I left the ssship and went north, ssso I ssshould head sssouth...

_Sanya does just that, heading south._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

_Emmett raises an eyebrow at Iris's suggestion._

> What the fuck is Marco Polo?

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

> But which way wasss sssouth again...?

_Sanya spins around and gulps._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

t!8ball Do Iris and Kyle reach Seth?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, ProfessorTree.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

> Itâ€™s a game. I learned about it on television.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_Jim jabs Emmett._

> Its a game from Earth.
> Kids play it.
> Thousands of years old, don't know why they still do it.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

> Television doesn't even exist...

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_Seth meets the others at his father's gate, holding his arms out welcomingly._

> Welcome to Osarai.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

> This is your home planet, I assume?

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> This is where I grew up.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> Oh wait, I think I left my extra augments in there!

_Jim runs to the ship, it almost completelyt submerged in the quicksand._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> So yes.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> Cool.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> I think I left my virginity in there...

_Emmett taps his chin in thought._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

_The ship suddenly falls under before Jim reaches the door._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

_Emmett chuckles softly._

> Oh wait, nevermind.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> Yep, nope, not doing that.

_Jim turns back to Emmett and Hector._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

_Iris is utterly amazed. She hasnâ€™t seen so many elves in one place since her home planet exploded._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> That was last ship.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> Wow...

_Iris holds her cheeks in awe._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> Amazing, huh?

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

> Good attempt, let's see if there is a way off this place...

_Hector, Emmett, and Jim head off in a direction, having no idea where the others went._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

> Hey, Seth...?

_As the trio travels, Emmett looks about himself, his hormonal urges coming back to him._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

> Yeah... looks just like home.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

> What's up?

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

> I detect over one-hundered life forms in our vicinity...

_KYL300 swivels his head around to scan each and every one of the elves._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

_Emmett's speaks awkwardly._

> Didn't you say something about there being some... things in the forest?

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

_Jim eyeballs Emmett suspiciously._

> As in plants, or...?

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

_Seth laughs._

> Oh yeah, a couple of woodland creatures and little communities.
> Most aren't elves.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

> Should I... disguise myself?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

> Come on Jim. Sanya, I guess too? Let's explore the forest if we're out of a ship...

_Emmett exits the swampland onto more solid ground._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

> Probably.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

> I'd suggest that.
> Elves are a little uneasy from robots.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett start trailing off to the forest in hopes of finding some fantasy women?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Zander.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

> I'm coming along with you two, I guess you know where you are going...

_Hector watches in bewilderment as Emmett speeds into the forest without a care in the world._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

> People gave me strange looks on my home planet, and Iâ€™m half-elf. Iâ€™m unsure if itâ€™s the same here, but.... just in case.

_Iris shrugs._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

> Hey, Emmett, wait up!

_Jim starts running after the horny squoatling._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

> No, don't worry about it.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

> Emmett, where the hell are you going?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Seth snorts, fromm Iris's comment._

> Half Elves are just a part of life, lots of orcs used to come by and rape our people.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Emmett runs deeper into the forest in hopes of a sexy furry babe to swoop him off his hooves._

> Filling my emptiness!

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

> Squoatling what are you doing?

_Hector sighs and races after the two._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Iris frowns from Seth's comment._

> That... is...
> Bad.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

> He's gone delusional, hasn't he?!

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

> Precisely!

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

_Emmett yells, his voice trailing away from Jim and Hector._

> There's women where I'm going!

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

> Ship crashes can do that to people, I could probably snap him out of it.

_Hector's face scrunches up from Emmett's excitement._

> Or, push come to shove, we can knock him out and carry him. He doesn't look that heavy.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 03:15 PM)_

_Jim stops to left Hector catch up with him._

> Won't be a problem if he was.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:15 PM)_

> Yeah, but the orcs are fine with us now.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:15 PM)_

_Iris looks to the side and holds her arm, a bit ashamed of her past._

> The Light Elves were mostly wary of me because of my part-archidemon heritage. There was... a war. It was unusual for that pairing to exist. Especially when one of them was...

_Iris shakes her head, sighing._

> Itâ€™s not important anymore.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 03:15 PM)_

> Your call human, what's the play here?

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 03:15 PM)_

> They really only raid our neighboring countries now...

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

> I say we follow him for a bit.
> He can't do much damage.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

> Okay...

_Jim and Hector follow Emmett from afar, making sure he doesn't get himself into too much trouble._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

> Thatâ€™s good, at least.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

_Emmett has stopped running for a bit now. He walks through the forest casually, a bit delusional in his goals._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

_Emmett stops at a tree, seeing some yellow and red speckled mushrooms. He leans down to them, curious if they're edible. Emmett's a big fan of mushrooms, after all._

_Seth winks at the tax accountant who just rolls his eyes._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 03:27 PM)_

_Hector aims his rifle at Emmett's arm._

_Iris frowns._

_Jim inches closer to Emmett in concern._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

_`Hooded Figure`: The hooded figure takes off their hood to reveal an illusion of Emmett's face._

> `Hooded Figure`: I am you!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

> Sorry, I... donâ€™t know what got into me... What did you want to do?

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

_Jim starts getting his shotgun out._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

_Kyle looks about him, his entourage having dispersed._

> I'm really not sure. Honestly, if possible, I'd love to get us a new ship.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

_Jim steps into the light._

> Ok, what the hell is going on here?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

_Emmett rubs his eyes in disbelief, but plays into the hag's illusion, being drugged from the mushrooms._

> Emmett, what happened to us?

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

> Sounds smart to me.

_Iris looks about, trying to find a ship depot._

> Unfortunately... I donâ€™t know if we have enough money for that?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

_The hag holds her arms out and Emmett falls into her carressing embrace, none the wiser of her intentions._

> Broken and sullen...

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

_Jim points his shotgun at the hag._

> Who the hell are you?!

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

> `Hooded Figure`: We need to stand up for what we believe in, Emmett.

_`Hooded Figure`: The hag raises her head, staring into Jim's eyes. The illusion switches to look like Jim's face, but only for Jim._

> `Hooded Figure`: Oh, I'm you, Jim.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

> We need to go on a mission, as a group.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

> Yeah.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

_`Hooded Figure`: The hooded figure gets out a baby milk bottle with Emmett's face on it._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_Jim's aim shakes from being startled by the hooded figure's ability._

> Emmett, you're injured, get over here and back away from... that thing!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

> Iâ€™m not certain I would be much help, though...

_Iris twists her shoe in the ground._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

> Emmett, the hell are you doing?!

_Emmett looks at Jim with a calm smile, then stares back up at himself._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

> Hey, Kyle, we're going to go browse ships after we have dinner at my father's castle.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_Kyle shrugs._

> I'm sure you could be useful in some way.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

> EMMETT, can you hear me?!

_Jim stomps to get his attention._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_`Hooded Figure`: The hooded figure winks at Jim enticingly._

> `Hooded Figure`: Jim, have a seat.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

t!8ball Does the hooded figure become Seth?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

_`Hooded Figure`: The hooded figure tries to convince Jim over to her, beckoning him._

> `Hooded Figure`: You've been a great cop, you know...

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

_Jim's brow furrows, trying to resist her charms._

> What the hell are you?!

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

> Sounds good, Seth.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

> Alright.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_`Hooded Figure`: The hooded figure lays Emmett down on a sofa and puts an arm around Jim, carressing his face._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

> Hey, come to town soon guys.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_Jimm pushes back the figure's arm and struggles to get out of her grasp._

> I don't know what you are, but you for sure aren't me!

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_Emmett relaxes on the couch._

> Jim, this is me...

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

t!8ball Does the group have enough money to get a new ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, ProfessorTree.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_Jim points his shotgun at the hooded figure once more._

> Emmett, I don't know what the hell you are doing, but this thing is screwing with our minds.
> We need to get out of here!

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Kyle, tired of standing around with Iris and doing nothing, calls into Emmett's comms._

> Hey, Emmett, what's going on over there? You guys doing alright?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_`Hooded Figure`: The hooded figure sticks the bottle in Emmett's mouth while steadily giving Jim a slow back massage._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> Also, we won't be buying a new ship, we'll be checking out some of my captured ships.

_Seth sighs, waving his mother goodbye and leaving the temple._

> Actually listen to me, damnit.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> Ah. Alright.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> Ok, thats enough!

t!8ball Does Jim get a shot off on the hooded figure with his shotgun?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, TheBlade.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_Upon Jim missing his shot, Hector jumps, having been half asleep while on guard._

> What the hell was that?!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> Hopefully one of them has enough rooms for all of us?

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> Jim, is everything okay in there?!

_Hector looks into the window, seeing the hooded figure grapple Jim violently._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> I captured a few back when I was a starfleet captain.

_Seth puffs his chest out, joining the others._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> HECTOR GET IN HERE!!

_Jim struggles to push the hooded figure away from him._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_The air inside is poisoned with the aroma of the mushrooms inside the hut._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> We could try two ships, if needed...

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

_Iris overhears the screaming over the comms._

> Christ what is happening over there?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

_Seth ignores it, and carries on._

> Mmm, we could, but I'm pretty sure I captured a few big ships.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

_Hector can tell that the mushrooms are emitting a harmful aroma. He digs into his bag for a gas mask._

> God dammit, I'll put my gas mask on, then be in there.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

> What if we... attached two ships? Or something?

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

_Kyle shrugs._

> Both sound like good ideas.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

_Jim catches a big whiff of the mushroom aroma and falls to the hag's lure, swaying woozily._

> ... That... actually is starting to feel kinda good...

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

_Iris thinks about her suggestion._

> Is... that possible?

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Seth scoffs at the idea._

> Sounds like a waste of time, we'll be fine with a big ship.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

> Cool.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett spit out the bottle and slip out of the figure's arm?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

> Great.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

_Emmett takes out the bottle from his mouth and temporarily comes to his senses._

> Uhm, no offense, but this is just too much, me.
> I just want someone I love to treat me like that.

_Emmett shrugs._

> Not me.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

> `Hooded Figure`: Oh, come on. You don't love me?

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector look in the hut again before running in?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, MultiTheDuck.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

> What the hell?!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris decide to check out whatâ€™s happening over there?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Jelsafan0.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

> Jim why are you letting that thing touch you?

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

_Iris, worried about her friends, decides to make her way over to them to make sure they're alright._

> You coming, Kyle? Seth?

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

_Jim falls back into the hooded figure's clutches, officially defeated._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

> Yeah, I'm kinda concerned...

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

_Hector busts into the hut, his rifle pointed at the hooded figure._

> Let them go now!

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

> I'll come with.

_And so, Iris, Kyle, Seth, Sanya, and Raven all head to the forest once more, using Kyle's GPS to find where the hut is._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

_Iris rushes ahead of the group and arrives at the hut. She steps inside without a second thought._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

> What... the actual...

_Iris smells the mushroom aroma._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

> `Hooded Figure`: "Iris, let me help you with that.

_`Hooded Figure`: The figure closes the door behind her and sits her down._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

_Hector tries to wave Iris out._

> Elf, step out now!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

> Wh-??

_Iris immediately starts to feel the effects of the dangerous mushrooms._

> Who... are you?!

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Hector slams on the wall._

> Dammit!

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Kyle looks into the window._

> Iris, what's going on?

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth arrive at the hut following Iris and Kyle?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Bagelwrecker.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

> I need to get that door open

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 8, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Seth stays back behind the others in the woods, taking a smoke break. He makes a plan to rush into the hut and catch the enemy later, whoever they are._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> Well this is strange yet... comfortable...

_Jim smiles and sits back in bliss._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_`Hooded Figure`: The figure gives Iris her favorite dress from before aand pats her back._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

t!choose Kyle takes out his laser rifle | Kyle takes out his energy sword

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | ProfessorTree, I pick Kyle takes out his laser rifle!

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Hector looks back and notices that the hooded figure locked the door behind him._

> I hope my handgun can break the lock...

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

> Why am I... home?

_Iris looks around herself, imagining that she was back on her old home planet._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Kyle gets out of his disguise and equips his laser rifle._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Iris holds her favorite dress that sunk into the quicksand from before and lightly fondles its texture._

> I thought... I thought this was... gone...?

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

t!8ball Does Kyle kick down the door?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, ProfessorTree.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_`Hooded Figure`: The hooded figure sticks Emmett into the bubbling cauldron._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Kyle diverts his attention to the cauldron before returning to the hooded figure._

> Alright, what the fuck is going on here?!

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

t!8ball Does Jim sit back, relax, and start sleeping?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, TheBlade.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Hector holds his hands out in shock from Emmett being placed in the cauldron._

> Woah, hold up!

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

> I think... I'm starting to get sleepy...

_Jim dozes off on the sofa._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

> Help me get the gas out of here, robot!

_Hector tries wafting the aroma out of the hut to no avail._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Kyle looks over to Hector awkwardly._

> I don't have a tool for that...

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

> I... I donâ€™t....

_Iris inspects her dress, hallucinating._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Kyle charges up his laser rifle._

> Hands off before I blow them apart, monster!

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

> Of course you don't!

_Hector smacks his face._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_`Hooded Figure`: The figure kicks Jim over into the oven before swarming at the unaffected people._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

_Hector holds his head in surprise._

> Shit!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

> Are you making...

_Iris sniffs, taking in the smell of the squoatling soup the figure was making._

> Soup?

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

> Hmmmm, nice and toasty... just like home.

_Jim shifts inside the oven, using a pan as a pillow._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

> Get out of the house!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

_Iris smiles to herself and giggles._

> ... I love soup.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_The soup is a bowl of dirty water and worms, along with boiled squoatling, of course._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

t!roll d10+3

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10+3... Rolled an 11, Zander.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_The crew has eleven minutes to save the squoatling and cyborg!_

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Iris's smile drops and looks around for someone from her memories._

> Where is Bridgette?
> Will Bridgette be home soon?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled an 8, Zander.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

_Emmett's body starts to singe from the hot, boiling water._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> I'll break Jim out, you get rid of this gas!

_Kyle races ahead to the oven._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

_`Hooded Figure`: Iris is slammed into a skillet atop of a stove. The high peoples' nervous systems are numbed enough to not feel anything._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> Shit!

_Kyle brings out his Titanium sword._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

_Despite being in a sizzling skillet, Iris feels as if she's in bed._

> Alright... guess Iâ€™ll just...

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

> Hurry, get them out of that oven!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

_Iris falls asleep._

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

_Sanya was hanging with Seth for a bit, figuring that the others' troubles weren't that severe. Upon hearing Hector and Kyle yell, she jumps up._

> I hear ssscreamsss. What'sss happenning?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth arrive at the hut drawn by the gun shots?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Concentrate and ask again, Bagelwrecker.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

> GET YOUR ASS IN HERE!
> GIANT MONSTER, JUST COME HELP!

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector hit the creature with his tranquilizer dart?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Concentrate and ask again, MultiTheDuck.

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

_Sanya runs out to the hut._

> I'm here, wh-What the fuck isss happening in here?!

_Sanya immediately draws her blade._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

> GIANT MONSTER!

_Kyle realizes the gas still hasn't dispersed._

> WAIT, FUCK!

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector hit the creature with his tranquilizer dart?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, MultiTheDuck.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

> GET OUT!

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Sanya backs up a bit from Kyle's demand._

> What can I do?

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Iris mumbles in her sleep._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Kyle realizes that Sanya wouldn't get high from the mushroom aroma._

> Wait, nevermind! Come in!
> Get Iris out of the damn skillet!

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

> Can do!

_Sanya rushes into the hut, looking around for the skillet hurriedly._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

> ...Calypso...

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

_`Hooded Figure`: The creature has a huge bone knife in two of its arms. Although Sanya can't get high from the aroma, its face changes to Sanya's for others not affected by the aroma._

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya grab Iris out of the skillet?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

_Sanya snags Iris out of the skillet, burning herself._

> Come here, I got y- OW, FUCK!

_Sanya grabs her hand, seething._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

_The sudden jolt wakes Iris._

> Bridgette...?

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

> Nope, tt'sss me, Sssanya.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

> GET HER OUTTA' HERE!

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

t!8ball Does the monster cradle Iris in her arms suddenly, whilst slapping Sanya away?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Ask again later, Zander.

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

_Sanya carries Iris starts to head out of the hut._

> Let'sss get you out of here.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 10, ProfessorTree.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

_Kyle tries his damnest to open up the stove with Jim inside, the stove feeling nigh impossible to open._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

> It won't budge!

_Kyle tries to slice open the over door with his blade._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:36 PM)_

_Irisâ€™s vision blurs and when it clears, sheâ€™s seeing reality. Apparently she wasn't deeply affected by the mushroom aroma._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:36 PM)_

> Wh-what?

_Iris looks around frantically._

> I-... I thought I was home?

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:36 PM)_

> No.

_Sanya sets Iris on the ground, away from the hut._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

_Iris grimaces._

> ... I shouldâ€™ve known.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

> Hey do we have any coffee, I'm parched...

_Jim mutters as the flames in the oven start to scorch his clothes._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

> What happened...?

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:38 PM)_

_Sanya sighs and looks over to the hut._

> Sssorry. I got to go back and help. Are you alright to stay here?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:38 PM)_

_`Hooded Figure`: The monster, visibly upset from the loss of its food, tosses the potted squoatling into the oven, cramming him in there with Jim._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:38 PM)_

> Can you tell me whatâ€™s going on? Maybe...

_Iris pushes herself up from the ground._

> Mmaybe I can help too?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

_Emmett stops suckling on the milk bottle and stares at it, not impressed. Of course, he has no care in the world that he was in the oven with Jim._

> Actually, this milk is kinda stale.

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

> Sssome sssort of gasss iss affecting the crew, getting them high. You won't be able to help.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

_Jim sips at a leaking pipe, hot oil dripping into his throat._

> The tea here is phenomenal...

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

_Kyle speaks over his comms._

> Iris, you step one foot in here again and you'll lose the ability to think. Stay out; there's a monster trying to eat everyone!

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

_Emmett tosses the bottle away._

> Pretty raunchy.

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

> I'll be back. Ssstay here.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

> Hey Jim.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

> You should try the tea...

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

_Emmett is taken aback, seeing Jim lying in a bed and himself in a bathtub._

> Why aren't you in a bath...?

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

> If I could just- just find a way to...

_Iris inches towards the hut._

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

_Sanya immediately swings her arm out, blocking Iris from leaving._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

_Jim's voice starts to slur._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector start slicing at the arms of the creature with his knife to distract it as Sanya frees Jim from the oven?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Better not tell you now, MultiTheDuck.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

_Jim starts to doze off again._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:42 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector inject himself with adrenaline before he starts slicing at the arms of the creature with his knife?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:42 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, MultiTheDuck.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:42 PM)_

_`Hooded Figure`: The hooded figure wags a finger at Hector, chastising him with a wooden spoon in another of her hands._

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:43 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya dart around the room to distract the beast?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:43 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Better not tell you now, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:44 PM)_

> Oh...

_Seth looks at his carton of space grass and frowns, considering that it took him so long to reach the hut._

> Guess someone laced my space grass.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:45 PM)_

t!8ball Does the monster move its arms away from Hector, retaliating sufficiently?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:45 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:45 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris figure out a way to use a torn piece of her shirt as an air filter so she can join the battle?

_`Hooded Figure`: The monster slaps Hector upside the head with her wooden spoon, leaving... a bruise. She grapples him._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

> Alright guys, stop playing games with your new friend! It's dinner time.

_Seth points to his watch as if the others could see him._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

_`Hooded Figure`: The monster looks out the window at Seth, smiling maliciously._

> `Hooded Figure`: It is! Want to see my cuisine, Seth?

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

_Iris tears off a piece of her sleeve and ties it around her mouth, using it as a makeshift air filter._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

_Kyle waves Seth in._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

_Hector struggles to get out of the monster's grasp._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 04:48 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu start going towards the hut?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:48 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Enchantingtable2013.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:48 PM)_

_Iris rushes into the hut._

> I figured something out and- HOLY ARCHIDEMONIC QUEEN, WHAT IS THAT!?

_Iris points at the hag in fear._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:48 PM)_

> YEAH IT'S NOT GOOD!!

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:48 PM)_

> Irisss, I sssaid, ssstay there!

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

> Its actually kinda getting a bit too warm in here.

_Jim frowns, sweating._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

> Well I didnâ€™t listen! What do I do?

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

> Can someone turn on the AC...?

_Jim knocks on the door to the oven._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

_Matieu, having made his way from the shipwreck to the hut, watches in amazement at the bizarre situation._

> God, what's happening in there?

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

> Help me open this oven!!

_Kyle continues to struggle to open the oven._

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

> Help Kyle open the oven!

_Sanya, upon seeing Matieu idle outside the hut, waves him in frantically._

> You, Bird! > Help usss!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

_Iris nods and hurries over to the oven to help Kyle._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

_Seth turns around and walks off._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

t!8ball Does the monster back up in front of the oven, grabbing a d20 cleaver?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Zander.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

> Matieu, leave!

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

> I'm going to go get something to eat...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

> What's going on though, Hector?!

_Matieu holds his head, conflicted whether to join the others inside the hut._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

> Everyone is high!

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth leave the scene and go home?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Reply hazy try again, Bagelwrecker.

> A demon abducted the squoatling, and elf, and Jim!, Get ready to treat several heavy burns!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:51 PM)_

_Iris shakes angrily._

> My name is Iris!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 04:51 PM)_

> Oh jeez, time for some field training!

_Matieu digs in his bag for remedies to treat burns._

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 4, ProfessorTree.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:52 PM)_

_Kyle continues to slash at the oven, having made multiple slashes and dents into it. With one final slash, the robot slices the hinges, causing the door to fall off._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:52 PM)_

> Stay out, we are going to send them out!

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:52 PM)_

> I got it open! I'll grab Jim, you get Emmett!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:52 PM)_

_Iris pulls Emmett out, his fur singed and his fur moist with sweat and stew._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 04:53 PM)_

> Ohhh, where we going now?

_Jim smiles stupidly as Kyle takes him out the hut._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:53 PM)_

_Seth turns around, having remembered Lama'entrian legend._

> Oh wait, is that O'lanara'porf the Swamp Creature?!

_Seth laughs excitedly._

> You mind autographing this picture for me?!
> Big fan!

_Seth rushes to the hut with a picture he hasily drew of the creature in his hands._

**Brakia** _(03-Sep-18 04:54 PM)_

_Sanya grabs the other half of Jim and stares daggers into Seth._

> Ssseth, could you HELP USSS?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:55 PM)_

> After I get this photo autographed...

_Seth makes it to the window of the hut and holds out his drawing._

> Sign my photo, O'lanara'porf.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:55 PM)_

`O'lanara'porf`: t!8ball Feeling particularly fond of the oven twins, does the monster do an attack to cripple Iris's and Kyle's arms?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:55 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:56 PM)_

_Seth shakes his arm as the monster attacks his crewmates._

> Hey, come on don't ignore me, sign my photo.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:56 PM)_

`O'lanara'porf`: t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:56 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 1, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

_With her arm crippled, Iris still attempts to slash back at O'lanara'porf with her dagger, but falls short of having her attack hit._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:58 PM)_

> My baath...

t!8ball Does Emmett grab ahold of a cabinet, thus hindering Iris' movement?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:58 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Zander.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 1, Zander.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

_Emmett, in his drugged stupor, manages to scratch at Iris's arm. He clearly wants back in the oven._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

> Emmett! Stop it!

_Iris scoffs._

> Seth, come take your son!

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

_Kyle slashes at the monster with its free arm, cutting its side deeply._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

> NOT UNTIL I GET THIS AUTOGRAPHED!!

_Seth slaps at the monster with his drawing._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

> Fuck, my arm!

_Kyle holds its arm in simulated pain, frayed wires protruding from it._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

_Hector grabs at Emmett's arm, trying to pull him away from the cabinet._

> Emmett, let go, before I make you!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

> If we knock it out, you can keep the whole thing!

_Iris manages to pull Emmett away from the cabinet._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

_Emmett cries loudly._

> I WANT MY SQUOMMA!

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

> This boat is rocky..

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

> `O'lanara'porf`: C'mere, squon.

_`O'lanara'porf`: The monster tries to grab at Emmett._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

_Iris, with her crippled arm, slaps at the monster and dodges her._

> NO!

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

> I WANT MY AUTOGRAPH!!

_Seth continues to wave the drawing incessantly._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

> NOT TODAY, YA KNOCKOFF DEMENTOR!

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:01 PM)_

> GIVE ME MY FUCKING AUTOGRAPH!!

_Seth slams on the windowsill for attention._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

t!8ball Foes Hector hit the creature the with a blinding dart, allowing the others to escape easier?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, MultiTheDuck.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

_`O'lanara'porf`: Hector's dart stabs into the monster's arm, but the monster brushes it off, scowling at Hector, haaving a raspy, deep voice._

> `O'lanara'porf`: I'm already blind, bitch!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris make it out with Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 1, JelsaFan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

_Once again Iris tries to slash at the monster to no avail as she exits the hut._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:03 PM)_

> How's it going, mister goatboy?

_Matieu helps carry Emmett out from the hut._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:03 PM)_

_Iris immediately drops Emmett once theyâ€™re outside, ripping the cloth from her mouth and taking desperate gasps for air._

> Christ dude...

_Iris wheezes._

> What the heck...

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

t!8ball Right as Iris gets out, does the monster grab Emmett back in by his backhoof?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Zander.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

_Matieu digs in his bag, unaware of Emmett being dragged back into the hut._

> How was the rave, Iris?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

`O'lanara'porf`: t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

_`O'lanara'porf`: The monster digs her claws into Emmett's leg deeply as she starts to drag him back into the hut._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

t!8ball Has Seth inhaled a lot of the gas from his screaming and is now high?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

_`O'lanara'porf`: The monster laughs devilishly, Seth now under her control._

> `O'lanara'porf`: Seth, it's me! You!

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

> We need our pyro to burn this bitch!

_Hector looks around for Chomsky, who is nowhere nearby._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

_Matieu turns around, having grabbed his burn remedies. He finds that Emmett has been dragged back into the hut._

> Well, god damnit.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

> GIVE ME MY FUCKING AUTOGRAPH!!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

> I need to prep...

_Matieu continues to set up, expecting the others to save his patient._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

> What rave?! Who are you?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

> I WILL TEAR MY OWN THROAT OUT OF MY NECK!

_Seth grabs at his neck, his threat to be taken seriously._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

_`O'lanara'porf`: The monster, as Seth, starts to kiss Seth to prevent him from killing himself._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

> Don't ask, I'll save your ass one day...

_Matieu looks stoicly into the hut, an aura of badassery emitting from his core._

> Just like I will with these ones.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

_`O'lanara'porf`: The monster's switches to female Seth, somehow affected by Seth's raw masculinity._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

> ... Are you a bird...?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu dash with Sanya to a flat area?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Enchantingtable2013.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

> Drop him, now!

_Hector stomps on the monster's hand that's embedded in Emmett's leg with all of his weight, causing an audible crack. Mid-kiss, the monster's grip weakens._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

_Matieu looks at Iris as if she's dense._

> Yes...?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

_Emmett's head looks super beat up from this commotion._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

_Iris shrugs._

> Cool.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

_Matieu rolls his eyes._

> Look, I need to focus to save lives.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

t!8ball Does Kyle throw Jim out the door and attempt to stab the monster?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, ProfessorTree.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

_Matieu shoos Iris away._

> So, go do what you do.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

> I'll do what I do best...

_Matieu continues to set up his traveling hospital._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

`O'lanara'porf`: t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

_`O'lanara'porf`: The monster manages to swipe at Hector with one of her blades, slicing into one of his shoulders, leaving a deep laceration._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

_Jim coughs after being thrown out the winddow._

> What the hell...?

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

t!roll d20

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20... Rolled a 11, ProfessorTree.

_Kyle slashes at the monster from behind, cutting her in the back from her first pair of shoulder to her hips._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

_Hector barks at Matieu, pointing at Jim._

> Matieu, drag Jim away from the door!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

_Iris sits down, tired._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

> Who chucked me off my ride...?

_Jim looks around for his boat, utterly confused._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:08 PM)_

_Iris beckons Jim away from the hut, trying to misdirect him._

> Hey Jim! Come here! Thereâ€™s something cool over here you have to see!

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:08 PM)_

> Eh?

_Jim shakes his head and looks in Iris's direction._

> What do you have there?

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

> I donâ€™t know, but itâ€™s cool and you have to see it!

_Iris holds nothing behind her back._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

> Ah, fuck. My head...

_Emmett holds his head, having it banged around by the others._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

> Is it shiny...?

_Jim starts crawling over to Iris._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

_Through kissed lips, Seth screams into the female Seth's mouth._

> GIV MA THA FACKING AUTAGROPH!

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

> I like Shiny...

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

_Emmett sits up, continuing to hold his head._

> What's going on?

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

> `O'lanara'porf`: _Seth's raw masculinity has almost completely changed the monster's motives. Female Seth starts french kissing Seth to try and overpower him with a charm._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:10 PM)_

> It is very shiny and great and youâ€™ve gotta come see it!

_Iris shakes her clenched hand._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:10 PM)_

t!8ball Does Jim start to get out of the high?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, TheBlade.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

_Emmett looks down at his bleeding leg, the monster still clutching it._

> What's on my foot...?

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

_Iris gives Jim a side hug when he reaches her._

> Youâ€™re welcome for getting you away from the fumes...

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:12 PM)_

> Oh god, that stench...

_Jim throws up._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:12 PM)_

_Iris winces from the display._

> Gross...

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:12 PM)_

> Eh... still got my stomach...

_Jim rubs his stomach and notices his arm is scalded._

> Oh god, what the hell happened?

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:13 PM)_

_Iris pats the grass next to her._

> Come sit down, itâ€™ll help with recovery. Iâ€™ll explain.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:14 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett try to take the monster's arm off of him?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Zander.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:14 PM)_

_Emmett manages to take the monster's grip off of his leg. He seethes through the pain, holding his lacerated leg._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:14 PM)_

> `Female Seth`: Mmmm, the things she told me were right, you most certainly are the best kisser of all the land...

_`Female Seth`: Female Seth holds Seth tighter._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:14 PM)_

_Jim grimaces at the display between the two Seths._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:15 PM)_

> I can kiss something else if ya know what I'm saying...

t!8ball Does the monster sign Seth's photo and then take Seth to bed with her?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:16 PM)_

_Iris watches the hut and sighs._

> ... Do you want me to burn it down?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:16 PM)_

_Emmett scowls sickly at Seth as the monster carries him back to her hut._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:17 PM)_

_Seth leans his head back at Emmett as he's carried to the hut._

> Emmett, you jelly?

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 05:17 PM)_

> Yes, after we get Seth and Emmett out.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:17 PM)_

> I feel sick...

_Emmett gags._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:17 PM)_

_Jim slowly stands, clearly not in a great state to head back into the hut._

> Just get me a mask, should be something I could use right?

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:17 PM)_

_Seth giggles._

> Puke in her mouth!

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:17 PM)_

> I got to get back in there...

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:17 PM)_

_Iris hands over the cloth she used to run into the hut._

> Worked for me.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:17 PM)_

> Thick gas then.
> Should work as long as it stays on...

_Jim ties the cloth like a bandana._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

> Yeah, just donâ€™t stay in there too long...

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett puke on both Seths?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

_Iris salutes._

> Good luck.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

_As the Seths pass him by, Emmett pukes on one of them._

t!choose Male | Female

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | Zander, I pick Female!

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

> Alright, robot, help me grab Emmett.

t!8ball Do KYL300 and Hector get Emmett outside of the hut and keep him away from the hut for good?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, MultiTheDuck.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:19 PM)_

_`Female Seth`: Female Seth backs in disgust from Emmett's puking, taking a finger and sticking some of it into her mouth._

> `Female Seth`: Son, what did I tell you about watching mommy and daddy?

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:19 PM)_

_Emmett gives a weak middle finger, er, digit, to the monster._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:19 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris come up with bait to lure Seth out?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Better not tell you now, Jelsafan0.

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 05:19 PM)_

> We're not getting Seth out of here, he's halfway in the mouth...

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 05:20 PM)_

_Kyle turns away from the hut, seemingly having given up on Seth._

> I'm getting out of here, burn down the house!

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:20 PM)_

_A loud thumping noise could be heard from the hut._

> Nah, I'm halfway into her pussy!

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 05:20 PM)_

> Come on everyone, leave the hut already!

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:20 PM)_

_Seth continues his thing, I guess._

> Damn bitch, you're fucking tight.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:20 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris come up with bait to lure Seth out?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:20 PM)_

_Emmett starts to cough heavily._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:21 PM)_

_`Seth`: Seth is currently getting devoured by the creature, his dick getting caught in the mid section full of teeth like things._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:21 PM)_

> Seth! Get out here!

_Iris shudders._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:21 PM)_

> Hector, is that all of them?

_Matieu inspects Emmett's wounds._

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

> The real question is, where's the monster...?

_Emmett looks at the hut weakly._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

_Iris pinches her nose in shame._

> Thereâ€™s a half-squid woman out here!

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

> I think there is one more in there somewhere...

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does the monster grab a hold of Seth's cock and start jerking him around like a baseball bat?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

> ... Sheâ€™s hot!

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

_A loud, wet, sloppy noise is heard from the hut._

> WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

> Well that's not really my job, I'm sure it's not very safe...

_Matieu takes a hand and cups it around his beak._

> GET YOUR ASS BACK HERE!

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

_Emmett sticks out his tongue, feeling like he's about to pass out. He quickly falls unconscious from his concussion and blood loss._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

_After Seth doesn't return to the others, Iris looks around at her crew desperately._

> Quick, someone make sexy squid woman noises!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

_Matieu grasps the situation as Emmett lies in a pool of blood._

> We need to start treating them, now!

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

> Stay here and start treating the wounded!

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

> We need to get in there, who is left inside?

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

> Seth!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu move Emmett to a flat area to begin treating him?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Enchantingtable2013.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

_Iris yells into her comms._

> Seth! Is there literally anything that could make you come out here?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

> Alright, we gotta make do with what we have, goatboy.

_Matieu takes out a spray and a rag to start treating Emmmett's wounded leg._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth pull the monster into the oven and lock into the 69 position?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

_Seth, in his naked tumble with the monster, drags her into the oven with himself._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

_Matieu gazes at Emmett's face, sterilizing his leg._

> Is he even awake, Hector?

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

_Hector takes a moment to open his eyes and lightly slap Emmett's face._

> No.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 7, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

_The already burning over scalds the skin of both Seths, causing their sexcapades to grow even louder._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

> Good.
> Time to work...

_Matieu snaps on his gloves._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

> ... That's it. Iâ€™m gonna make him come out...

_Iris heads to leave for the hut._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

> Guys, there is still someone in there!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

_Matieu grabs Iris's hand._

> Don't. He does alot of stupid stuff.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

_Emmett bleats like a baby, or a goat kid, in this case._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

> Just let him be...

_Matieu lets go of Iris and starts surgery on Emmett's leg._

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

_Seth screams, his whole body in a state of bliss and agony._

> AND IT BURNS, BURNS, BURNS, THE RING OF FIRE! THE RING OF FIRE!

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

> Don't hurt yourself!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

_Iris produces a ball of fire from her hand._

> COME OUT BEFORE I BURN IT DOWN!

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:27 PM)_

_Seth thumps harder, burning himself against the oven's coils._

> Bye bye, son!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:27 PM)_

_Matieu stares at Emmett questionably from the noise he made._

> That's, cute I guess.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:27 PM)_

> I'll be fine, we cant leave anyone in there.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:27 PM)_

> Now I'm gonna feel bad when I cut into you.

_Matieu grumbles to himself, resuming his surgical procedure._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:27 PM)_

> Seth, I will literally negotiate with you!

_Iris holds out her hands pleadingly._

> What will it take to make you come out?

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:28 PM)_

_Seth ignores Iris, his body literally burning alive from the heat of the oven._

> Stay alive Emmett, don't die after I do my boy.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:28 PM)_

_Jim walks off with Kyle, taking one last stare at the hut._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:28 PM)_

> He may have a brain hemorrhage, Hector...

_Matieu takes out stitches._

> If he hit his head hard enough it might begin to clot.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:29 PM)_

_Emmett bleats softly in his unconscious state._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:29 PM)_

> Iâ€™m just-

_Iris watches as the thumping from the hut slows. She shakes, not wanting to be the cause of Seth's death._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 05:29 PM)_

> Fix it, Matieu!

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:29 PM)_

> Just gonna-

_Iris throws a fireball at the hut, her mind filled with guilt._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:29 PM)_

> Okay, on it.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:30 PM)_

t!8ball Does the cabin catch fire and Seth and the monster burn to death?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:30 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:30 PM)_

> Guys, we can just stand here, we have to---oh dear god!

_Jim watches wide-eyed as the hut burns to the ground._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:30 PM)_

_Iris's mouth quivers. She turns around, not wanting to look at the hut that was burning down behind her._

> Well, guess heâ€™s dead.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:30 PM)_

_Seth's voice weakens, his screams being engulfed by the flames._

> AND IT BURNS! BURNS! BURNS! THE RING OF FIRE!

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:31 PM)_

_Emmett wakes up and just looks pretty emotionless right now, occasionally bleating._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:31 PM)_

t!8ball Does Jim see anything coming out of the wreckage?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:31 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, TheBlade.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 05:31 PM)_

_Hector watches the hut apathetically, noticing how the burning ashes were starting to light the grass on the ground._

> Lets just get away from here, Jim and the robot, help us move the wounded away...

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:31 PM)_

> Yeah. Okay.

_Iris, with a frown on her face, heads to Emmett._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 05:31 PM)_

> On it.

_Kyle looks at Emmett on the ground._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:32 PM)_

> Iâ€™ll take Emmett. Again...

_Iris bends down to pick up her blubbering compatriot._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:32 PM)_

_Jim takes his sunglasses off and watches the fire in awe._

> I can't believe he actually did it, the crazy fucker actually pulled it off...

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett try to get up, but ends up falling down?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

_Iris picks up Emmett, and carries him like a sack of potatoes away from the hut._

**ProfessorTree** _(03-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

> Damn, I can't believe he's dead...

_Kyle kicks the dirt solemnly._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

> Careful there, you don't want to hurt yourself...

_Hector tries to help Iris pick up Emmett, but she pulls him away._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:35 PM)_

> ... Iâ€™ll be fine.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:36 PM)_

_Seth's ashes fly off in the wind, with his military cap flying off almost unscathed._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 05:36 PM)_

t!8ball Once the group is a safe distance away, do Matieu And Hector Start treating the wounded?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:36 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, MultiTheDuck.

**Zander** _(03-Sep-18 05:36 PM)_

_Seth's cap lands on one of Emmett's horns._

**TheBlade** _(03-Sep-18 05:37 PM)_

_Jim notices the cap land on Emmett and starts to tear up._

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 05:37 PM)_

t!roll d25

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d25... Rolled a 18, WatchfulDrake.

**WatchfulDrake** _(03-Sep-18 05:37 PM)_

_Hector helps Matieu work on Emmett's leg and both his and Jim's burns, patching them both up pretty well._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:37 PM)_

> ... Iâ€™m sorry for your loss...

_Iris pats Emmett's shoulder._

**Jelsafan0** _(03-Sep-18 05:40 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris drop Emmett by mistake and then find Concussion-B-Gone in Sethâ€™s hat?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:40 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Jelsafan0.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:40 PM)_

> t!8ball Does Matieu cuts open Emmett's skull?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:40 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Enchantingtable2013.

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:47 PM)_

_`Comms System`: As if noticing that Seth's body was completely disintegrated, a programmatic message blares out to each crew member._

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:48 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(03-Sep-18 05:48 PM)_

_Matieu bandages up Emmett's head to the best of his ability, hanging Seth's military cap back on his horn._

> There, perfect...

**Bagelwrecker** _(03-Sep-18 05:49 PM)_

t!8ball Did Raven burn to death?

**Tatsumaki** _(03-Sep-18 05:49 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Bagelwrecker.
