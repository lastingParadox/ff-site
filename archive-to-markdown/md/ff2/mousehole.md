@Magic8Ball Did Seth bring a drink or two with him?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

🎱 | Resounding no, Zander.

> You should drink with me more Emmett.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

> Y'know? Maybe.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

> Oh.. So we have to share a room?

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

_Steel pulls out his holodevice and starts scrolling through Splitter._

> Oooooo!

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> We can reminisce about the days when I first founndd ya.

> No thanks.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> Unllesss Emmett wants to deal with my sexyy women we pick up.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

_Maia blushes._

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

> I'm not sharing with you and you know that.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Ibraxas set his things on the shelf on his side of his room.

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

> Make sure you don't spill you milk over there!

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

> Ahh, you're such a prude Emmett. You know women don'tt like thatt.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

> You can choose your room for now. But someone else will end up sharing it with you.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

_Ibraxas enters his room, unloading his belongings._

> I'll put my sniper on this shelf...

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

_Garrick awakes on the couch. His eyes pop open, making a loud gong sound._

> This’ll be fun.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Maia find a room?

_Garrick floats out to the hallway, where Ibraxas and Maia have already left._

> I could care less who I end up sharing a room with.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> Ooh! Here's an empty one.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> Your dick is overused, man.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> Emmett, I'll find a wife forrr you soon enoughh my friend.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Are the rooms fit for two anyways?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 20! Yes, Zander.

_Emmett leaves the cockpit and heads towards the crew's quarters._

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

> Ah, ok.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Ibraxas question his existence... again?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

🎱 | Astounding yes, Brakia.

> You know I can sleep with my eyes open?

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> ...That’s weird.

_Garrick turns off his communicator._

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> Wow!

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

_Ibraxas mutters to himself in his room._

> I'm still concerned about what I am...
> I don't even know what race I am.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> There, there...

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> I learned how to do it back when I was maybe Emmett's age.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

_Garrick pokes his head through Ibraxas's wall._

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do I run to the bathroom to puke?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

🎱 | YES, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

> I wish I had some answers.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

_Steel flips a coin. It lands on "tails"._

> Awwwwn.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:24 PM)_

_Seth yells at the top of his lungs in-between vomiting._

> Shuttt up, I'm pukkking herrree!

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:24 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is Emmett's "room" occupied by someone else?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:24 PM)_

🎱 | Nah, Zander.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:24 PM)_

_Emmett turns his comms back on quickly._

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 2! No, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

_Seth wipes his chin with Emmett's lime-green towel._

> You know, I miss when we had that dark elf on our ship, remember her Emmett?

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

_Mica runs down the hallway and reaches Emmett, exasperated._

> What is it?

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

> She was disgusting, Seth.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

> I can T-Pose anything that isn't living.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

_Asier emerges from the janitor's closet, right next to Ibraxas's room._

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

> I see there are some new faces.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

> There's a mess in the bathroom. Might want to clean that up.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

_Steel watches a JoyHole level 3 video of an Avian puking white liquid at gunpoint._

> I hope he was drinking spilt milk.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

_Asier looks shocked._

> Who told you I was the janitor!?

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

> You can clean itt upp, Ibraxas.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

_Ibraxas points forcefully at Asier._

> I made you the janitor.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

> I got women to woo.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

> Or, half of me did.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

> I like it in here. Pretty cozy.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

_Ibraxas puts his hands on his head in a panic._

> I'm confusing me.

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

> ......

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

> And a star.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

> Where are we going next?

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

> Why have you become something else?

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

_Ignoring Asier, Ibraxas routes his comms to the whole crew._ 

> Let's go to space disney.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

> No!

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Maia show Emmett something special?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

_Asier looks at Ibraxas, confused._

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

> Why? I don't know why.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth launch the ship to go to Space Disney?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

🎱 | NO, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

_Emmett hears the commotion from down the hall, but isn't particularly excited by it._

> Space Disney is alright.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

> Space dindu nuffin.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Maia now show Emmett something special?

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

> It's like disney, but in space.

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 5! No, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

> Alright, welp, I'm good now.

_Seth throws Emmett's towel in the toilet and struts toward the kid's room._ 

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

_Steel snaps out of his trance._

> Disney... but Star Wars themed!?

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

> Is space Disney like regular Disney but only about stellar warfare?

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

> Let's go find a some women Emmett.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Maia pokes her head through the door, excitedly._

> Hey Seth? Wanna try some special alcohol from Saturn?

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Emmett frowns, realizing that he'll have to deal with a drunken Seth soon._ 

> I guess I'll drive then.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

> Is it the Dioop Monds?

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Garrick floats and rests his head on Seth's, butting into the conversation._

> You guys really like alcohol, don'tcha?

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Asier also floats and stacks his head on Garrick's._

> Please don't throw up again.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

> I drank that at Mora's.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

_Steel tries to stack with the ghosts and falls on his face, but butts in anyway._

> I don't approve.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

> Selene's Hair. It's some of the strongest liquor in the galaxy.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

_Seth somehow stacks his head on Asier's._

> I don't think so, they have a no-drunk rule at Space Disney.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

_Garrick exits the stack, causing the others to topple over._

> I'd tag along, but I'm afraid of what would come out of it.

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

> Yeah, you might get PTSD again.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

> Garrick, go get drunk man.
> Relax.
> Celebrating.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

> Whatever you say.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

> Woo hoo!

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

> I don't think he can drink.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

_Garrick scoffs, offended._
