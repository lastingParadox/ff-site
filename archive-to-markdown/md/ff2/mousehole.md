**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:03 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:04 PM)_

> "And then I'll shoot you in the head."

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:04 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Should Maia explore the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | NO, Mica.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:04 PM)_

> Ha ha, Mora!

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:04 PM)_

_Steel hears a woman's voice coming from the ship and runs to investigate._

> That's a girl!

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:04 PM)_

> I'll just stay put so I don't accidentally break something.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:05 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do I head back to the ship while drunk off my ass?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:05 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, Brakia.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:07 PM)_

> I prefer not to drink myself to death, thanks.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:07 PM)_

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:08 PM)_

_Steel peeks his head into the cockpit._

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Ibraxas give his arm a tune up while waiting to get a move on?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, Brakia.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

> I hope you were drinking milk.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

> Hey, Maia, Ibraxas.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

_Seth ignores Steel and raises his watch to his mouth, activating his comms._

> Remember that time we drank with the dwarvess Emmett?

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:10 PM)_

> Yeah?

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:11 PM)_

> Yes?

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:11 PM)_

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Mica.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

> You nearly ate the dwarves and I had to extinguish a fire you produced.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

_Steel speaks up from the corner._

> He's got a point.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

> Or some Diamo Nade Vodka!
> That's good vodka.
> I like vodka.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

> Hmm. Maybe there's a spare room around here...

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:12 PM)_

> I like alcohol in general.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Did Seth bring a drink or two with him?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

> You should drink with me more Emmett.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

> Be careful which room you pick. We don't have enough for everyone to have their own.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

> Y'know? Maybe.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

> Oh.. So we have to share a room?

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:13 PM)_

_Steel pulls out his holodevice and starts scrolling through Splitter._

> Oooooo!

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> We can reminisce about the days when I first founndd ya.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> Everyone has to share with someone.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

_Seth hears Mica's voice through comms and assumes he's being spoken to._

> Share?
> No thanks.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> Oh boy...

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

_Steel mutters to himself._

> Po-I mean, corn.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> Yeah.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> Uh, yeah.
> We don't have _that_ much space.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:14 PM)_

> Unllesss Emmett wants to deal with my sexyy women we pick up.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

_Maia blushes._

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

> I'm not sharing with you and you know that.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Ibraxas set his things on the shelf on his side of his room.

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, Brakia.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

> Um... Who do I share with?

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:15 PM)_

> Make sure you don't spill you milk over there!

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

> Ahh, you're such a prude Emmett. You know women don'tt like thatt.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

> You can choose your room for now. But someone else will end up sharing it with you.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

> I see...

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:16 PM)_

_Ibraxas enters his room, unloading his belongings._

> I'll put my sniper on this shelf...

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

_Garrick awakes on the couch. His eyes pop open, making a loud gong sound._

> Thisâ€™ll be fun.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Maia find a room?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, Mica.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do I get the second largest room?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yay, Bagelwrecker.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

_Garrick floats out to the hallway, where Ibraxas and Maia have already left._

> I could care less who I end up sharing a room with.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> Ooh! Here's an empty one.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> Your dick is overused, man.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

> Emmett, I'll find a wife forrr you soon enoughh my friend.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

> I prefer not to see it literally every night.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

_Garrick hears Seth still slurring through his comms._

> Are you alright, Seth?

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

> I'm a litttle drunkk.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

> He's drunk.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

> Oh.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

> Erm.. The bed might not be able to fit my body..

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:18 PM)_

> We'll get you a larger bed.
> Or maybe hay?

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

@Magic8Ball does garrick find a room

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Next person decides for you, RPretribution.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

> I don't know what your race likes sleeping on.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Are the rooms fit for two anyways?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 20! Yes, Zander.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

> I usually sleep on clouds...

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

> Clouds are reallly expeensive.
> ...and wet.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:19 PM)_

> How does a centaur sleep, anyways?
> Standing up?

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

> I'll make do.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

> Okay.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

> We sleep standing up.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

> I'm going back to the room I was in.

_Emmett leaves the cockpit and heads towards the crew's quarters._

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

> Ah, ok.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Ibraxas question his existence... again?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:20 PM)_

> You know I can sleep with my eyes open?

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> ...Thatâ€™s weird.

_Garrick turns off his communicator._

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> Wow!

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

_Ibraxas mutters to himself in his room._

> I'm still concerned about what I am...
> I don't even know what race I am.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> There, there...

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> I learned how to do it back when I was maybe Emmett's age.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

_Garrick pokes his head through Ibraxas's wall._

> Youâ€™re an... abomination.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> Do I even bleed?

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Maia teleport a cloud bed into her room?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Person who just went decides for you, Mica.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

> I have to question everything now.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

> Youuu wannaa checckk, Ibraxas?

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

> Hmmmm...

_Steel puts his finger to his chin inquisitively, pondering if he should do anything this episode._

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

> There we go!
> Cloud bed.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

> I'm just...a big question.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do I run to the bathroom to puke?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

> I wish I had some answers.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:23 PM)_

_Steel flips a coin. It lands on "tails"._

> Awwwwn.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:24 PM)_

_Seth yells at the top of his lungs in-between vomiting._

> Shuttt up, I'm pukkking herrree!

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:24 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is Emmett's "room" occupied by someone else?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Zander.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:24 PM)_

_Emmett turns his comms back on quickly._

> Maia.
> Come in here. I think you want to see this.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

> Coming!

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Ibraxas take off his robot arm and leave it on his bed?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 2! No, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

_Seth wipes his chin with Emmett's lime-green towel._

> You know, I miss when we had that dark elf on our ship, remember her Emmett?

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

_Mica runs down the hallway and reaches Emmett, exasperated._

> What is it?

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

> She was disgusting, Seth.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

> I can T-Pose anything that isn't living.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

> She hadd a very nice asss.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

> Look here, Maia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

@Magic8Ball does asier join in

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

_Emmett pulls up his windowshades._

> Huge window to the cosmos.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

> Big boobs tooo.

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

_Asier emerges from the janitor's closet, right next to Ibraxas's room._

> Hey guys.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

> I thought you might have liked it.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

> Hey, Shade.

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

> I see there are some new faces.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

> There's a mess in the bathroom. Might want to clean that up.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

_Steel watches a JoyHole level 3 video of an Avian puking white liquid at gunpoint._

> I hope he was drinking spilt milk.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

> It looks incredible. It makes me feel at home.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

_Seth yells through his comms._

> Thatt's meee.

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

_Asier looks shocked._

> Who told you I was the janitor!?

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

> You can clean itt upp, Ibraxas.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

_Ibraxas points forcefully at Asier._

> I made you the janitor.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

> I got women to woo.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

> Or, half of me did.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

> I like it in here. Pretty cozy.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

_Ibraxas puts his hands on his head in a panic._

> I'm confusing me.

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

> ......
> Weren't you a dinosaur before?

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

> And a star.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

> Where are we going next?

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

> Why have you become something else?

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

_Ignoring Asier, Ibraxas routes his comms to the whole crew._ 

> Let's go to space disney.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

> No!

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Maia show Emmett something special?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | N0, Mica.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

> Let's go to spacee universall!

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

_Asier looks at Ibraxas, confused._

> Did... knee?

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

> Why? I don't know why.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Seth launch the ship to go to Space Disney?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | NO, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

_Emmett hears the commotion from down the hall, but isn't particularly excited by it._

> Space Disney is alright.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

> Space dindu nuffin.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

> Space Disney?

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:29 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Maia now show Emmett something special?

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

> It's like disney, but in space.

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 5! No, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

> Alright, welp, I'm good now.

_Seth throws Emmett's towel in the toilet and struts toward the kid's room._ 

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

_Steel snaps out of his trance._

> Disney... but Star Wars themed!?

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

> Is space Disney like regular Disney but only about stellar warfare?

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

> Let's go find a some women Emmett.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Maia pokes her head through the door, excitedly._

> Hey Seth? Wanna try some special alcohol from Saturn?

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Emmett frowns, realizing that he'll have to deal with a drunken Seth soon._ 

> I guess I'll drive then.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

> Is it the Dioop Monds?

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Garrick floats and rests his head on Seth's, butting into the conversation._

> You guys really like alcohol, don'tcha?

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Asier also floats and stacks his head on Garrick's._

> Please don't throw up again.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

> I drank that at Mora's.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

_Steel tries to stack with the ghosts and falls on his face, but butts in anyway._

> I don't approve.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

> Selene's Hair. It's some of the strongest liquor in the galaxy.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

_Seth somehow stacks his head on Asier's._

> I don't think so, they have a no-drunk rule at Space Disney.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

_Garrick exits the stack, causing the others to topple over._

> I'd tag along, but I'm afraid of what would come out of it.

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

> Yeah, you might get PTSD again.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

> Garrick, go get drunk man.
> Relax.
> Celebrating.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

> Whatever you say.
