**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:17 PM)_

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

_Ibraxas mutters to himself in his room._

> I'm still concerned about what I am...

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> There, there...

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

> I learned how to do it back when I was maybe Emmett's age.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:21 PM)_

_Garrick pokes his head through Ibraxas's wall._

_Steely flips a coin. It lands on "tails"._

_Seth yells at the top of his lungs in-between vomiting._

_Seth wipes his chin with Emmett's lime-green towel._

> You know, I miss when we had that dark elf on our ship, remember her Emmett?

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:25 PM)_

_Mica runs down the hallway and reaches Emmett, exasperated._

> What is it?

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

> She was disgusting, Seth.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:26 PM)_

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:27 PM)_

_Steely watches a JoyHole level 3 video of an Avian puking white liquid at gunpoint._

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 05:28 PM)_

_Ignoring Asier, Ibraxas routes his comms to the whole crew._

_Seth throws Emmett's towel in the toilet and struts toward the kid's room._ 

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:30 PM)_

_Steely snaps out of his trance._

> Disney... but Star Wars themed!?

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

> Is space Disney like regular Disney but only about stellar warfare?

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Maia pokes her head through the door, excitedly._

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Emmett frowns, realizing that he'll have to deal with a drunken Seth soon._ 

> I guess I'll drive then.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

> Is it the Dioop Monds?

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Garrick floats and rests his head on Seth's, butting into the conversation._

> You guys really like alcohol, don'tcha?

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:31 PM)_

_Asier also floats and stacks his head on Garrick's._

> Please don't throw up again.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

> I drank that at Mora's.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

_Steely tries to stack with the ghosts and falls on his face, but butts in anyway._

> I don't approve.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

> Selene's Hair. It's some of the strongest liquor in the galaxy.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

_Seth somehow stacks his head on Asier's._

> I don't think so, they have a no-drunk rule at Space Disney.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 05:32 PM)_

_Garrick exits the stack, causing the others to topple over._

> I'd tag along, but I'm afraid of what would come out of it.

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

> Yeah, you might get PTSD again.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 05:33 PM)_

> Garrick, go get drunk man.

> Please, DON'T LEAVE THEM ALONE!

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Maia make a drunk decision?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

🎱 | Lowercase yes, Mica.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

> Ibraxas, leave them alone.
> Let them have fun.

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

> We don't want more crew members, if you know what I mean.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

> Be careful.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

> Relax, Ib. I'm responsibel.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

> Sure you are.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

> Emmett knows how to use protection.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:01 PM)_

> Don't our friends need money??? I should deposit money into their account!!!!!!~

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

> Maia, no!

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

> That's not a good idea, Maia.

_Ibraxas holds his face in his palm for a moment._

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett switch places with Seth?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

🎱 | Nay, Bagelwrecker.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

> But they won't be able to get anything!!

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

> We have enough money. Chill.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:02 PM)_

> Emmett, don't forget to water the grass.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:03 PM)_

> Oh shit. The grass.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:03 PM)_

> Just don't. I'm sure they're fine.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:03 PM)_

_Maia sits on the floor and slumps her body over the couch._

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:03 PM)_

> You know what happens when you don't, it gets shriveled and dry.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

_Emmett walks past Maia, stepping over her wings._

> I'm getting to it, relax.

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

> This must be a rather boring job.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

> I don't want you to get _The Crave_.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

_Garrick yawns._

> Are we going to get tickets or what?

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

> "The Crave?"

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

> The Crave.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Garrick enter the park without a ticket?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:04 PM)_

🎱 | Y35, RPretribution.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

_Garrick strolls through the entrance, passing through the plasma-field gates without issue._

> This is taking too long.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

> Hehehe~

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

_Asier yells from outside._

> Garrick!
> Why!?

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

> I told you. It was taking too long.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

> You're really drunk, aren't you?

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett find any grass?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

🎱 | Lowercase yes, Zander.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

> Also, I don't have a lot of money with me.
> And I'm kinda drunk. But whatever, let's go.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

> Yeahhh~

_Maia kicks in Ibraxas's direction, who steps away in disgust._

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:05 PM)_

> Crap, man.
> Seth, I forgot something.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> What'd you forget?

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> My stash.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> Just how strong is that stuff?

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> STRONGGGGG~

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> Yeeeah buddy!

_Steely snaps out of it and exits the ship, standing at the park's entrance._

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

_Emmett raises his watch and bleats loudly through everyone's comms._

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

_Asier covers his ears in pain, despite not having comms._

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> Fuck, and my parents already took the ship!

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do Earth cops have jurisdiction on Space Disney?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

🎱 | Zander says yes, TheBlade.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

_Garrick begins pocketing items from a nearby stand while the owner isn't looking._

> Asier.
> Hurry up.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> What should I do?

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> What?
> No.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:06 PM)_

> You want me to call them?

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:07 PM)_

> Fine, whatever.

_Garrick throws a large plushie of Zog in Asier's direction._

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:07 PM)_

> Guys, how much is it to get in the place?

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:07 PM)_

> So...
> Dragon fellow.
> Fgdhodjcdyx.

_Asier begins spitting in Steely's direction, mocking him._

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

_Jim rustles through his money bag, a mix of Earth coins and Duckett coins._

> I got a 100 on me.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Ibraxas start work on the hull?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

🎱 | Likely no, Brakia.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

> Maia, I think I might be needing to go out the ship.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

> I should dance.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

> Dragon Bois!

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

> You guys pay for tickets. I'm gonna go hide by the concessions.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:08 PM)_

> So do you want me to call my parents?

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> Hehe..

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> You probably should not.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> I think it's too late for that.

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

@Magic8Ball do we go in now, bringing the Dragon fellow with us?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

🎱 | Lowercase no, PlasmaPerson.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> But dancing is fuuuuunnnn!

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> Ok...
> How long has it been since you had grass?

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> Well, it's not the worst thing you can do.

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:09 PM)_

> You should ditch this boring job and have a little fun instead.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

> All my life I knew I was an anime protagonist.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

> I don't remember. Like, a week maybe?

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

> I know, right? Come with us.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

> Oh fuck.

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

> Why do we have 2 goats...i thought one was enough...

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

> I'll probably break something...

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

> You want me to lock you in your room?

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

> Maybe.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

> You could try to break me.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

_Maia sniffles._

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 06:10 PM)_

> Yeah I'm like that.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:11 PM)_

> Emmett, no.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:11 PM)_

> What's wrong?

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:11 PM)_

> I.. I'm too big!!!

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:11 PM)_

_Jim raises his comms to his mouth._

> Hey guys. What the hell am I listening to?

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 06:11 PM)_

_Steely is baffled at Asier's request._

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:11 PM)_

> Emmett, go get your doll thing.

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:11 PM)_

> Maia, what the hell is going on?

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:11 PM)_

> Okay, I'm turning off my comm.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:11 PM)_

> Wh...

_Maia sniffles._

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:11 PM)_

> Awh, crap. I don't like seeing you unhappy, Maia.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:12 PM)_

> This is a mess.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:12 PM)_

> Drunk problems, Jim.

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:12 PM)_

> What do you mean it's "too big?"

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:12 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Maia have a beautiful drunk cry?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:12 PM)_

🎱 | Nay, Mica.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:12 PM)_

> She said that she's too big.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:12 PM)_

_Garrick gives a loud horsey sound out of boredom._

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:12 PM)_

_Emmett turns off Maia's comms._

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:12 PM)_

> She's being sad.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:12 PM)_

> NO. I'm not gonna cry.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 06:13 PM)_

> I can't wait for Trump to add lazers back to Final Frontier.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:13 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do I climb over Space disney's fence?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:13 PM)_

🎱 | Yeah, Bagelwrecker.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:13 PM)_

_Garrick flips on his communicator._

> What's going on in there?

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:13 PM)_

_Asier whispers to Steely._

> Together we can trash this place.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:13 PM)_

> Drunk things.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:13 PM)_

> Si, señor!

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:13 PM)_

> Maia, c'mere.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:13 PM)_

_Maia wipes her eyes._
> Okay.

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:13 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does everyone in the parking lot go up to the ticket booth?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:13 PM)_

🎱 | Wait to ask this again, TheBlade.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 06:13 PM)_

_Steely looks over at a crowd of people filming and documenting the crew's parking lot desecration._

> Several people are typing...

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:14 PM)_

> Uhhh...
> Okay?

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:14 PM)_

> what?

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:14 PM)_

_Emmett gives Maia the biggest hug he can, despite their size difference._

> There there, you big baby.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:14 PM)_

> Emmett, don't be rude.

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:14 PM)_

> OK, can we just all go into Disney please?!

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:15 PM)_

@Magic8Ball does garrick hide somewhere and wait for asier and jim

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:15 PM)_

🎱 | Likely yes, RPretribution.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:15 PM)_

_Maia gives a pouty face._

> I'm one hundred years old.

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:15 PM)_

_Jim quickly flips his communicator back on and mumbles..._

> Legal.

_...and then turns it back off._

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:15 PM)_

> Señors, I'm over the border.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:15 PM)_

> You're not technically wrong, Jim.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:16 PM)_

> I still saved you all though.

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 06:16 PM)_

_Steely throws his arms around Jim and Asier._

> Señiors!

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:16 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Is Emmett almost in The Crave?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:16 PM)_

🎱 | Y35, Zander.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:17 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:17 PM)_

@Magic8Ball does steel now join us to have fun and trash space Disney

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:17 PM)_

🎱 | Yeah, PlasmaPerson.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:17 PM)_

> Hmm?

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:17 PM)_

> Vamanos!

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:17 PM)_

> It is time!

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:17 PM)_

_Garrick stops bouncing on the hotdog stand's awning and lands on the ground._

> Woo! Let's go!

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:18 PM)_

> We need to be more careful about things, y'know?

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:18 PM)_

> Over the fence, brothers.

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:18 PM)_

> Eh, people will think I'm still a cop so, should be good.

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:18 PM)_

_Asier draws his swords._ 

> Now, let's go meet up with the others.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:18 PM)_

> Give me a hug.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:18 PM)_

> First we should have everyone dress up as Emmett.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:19 PM)_

_Emmett looks at Seth in disgust._

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:19 PM)_

_Jim looks at Seth in interest._

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:19 PM)_

> Everyone who is here put these costumes on.

_Seth comes out of the ship with an array of Squoatling costumes, of all different colors._

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:19 PM)_

_Jim puts on the costume without question, but does not realize it yet._

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:19 PM)_

@Magic8Ball does Maia give Emmett a hug?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:19 PM)_

🎱 | Lowercase yes, Mica.

> We have a jewel to steal.

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:21 PM)_

> Why the hell did I put this on?

**PlasmaPerson** _(02-Jul-18 06:21 PM)_

> Too bad!
> At least this way they won't suspect anyone but Emmett.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:21 PM)_

> But I need to go.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:21 PM)_

> Where?

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:21 PM)_

> I still have a cop uniform on, I just have a mask on.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:21 PM)_

> Emmett, we're ready over here.

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:21 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Jim have a paper Emmett mask on?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:22 PM)_

🎱 | Astounding yes, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:22 PM)_

> Turn to what?

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:22 PM)_

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:22 PM)_

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:23 PM)_

@Magic8Ball does Garrick take off the Emmett costume?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:23 PM)_

🎱 | Nay, RPretribution.

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:23 PM)_

> Emmett do you need to lay down?

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:23 PM)_

> It's when Emmett goes insane.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:23 PM)_

> I hate this!

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:23 PM)_

> Dont' lay down next to Maia...

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 06:23 PM)_

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:24 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett get out of the ship, getting into THE CRAVE?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:24 PM)_

> I'm heading to the museum. Vamanos.

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:25 PM)_

> Whoa, don't destroy anything, what are you thinking?

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:25 PM)_

> When and where?

_Maia completely ignores Emmett's condition in order to flirt continuously._

**TheBlade** _(02-Jul-18 06:25 PM)_

> Just have some fun dude...

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:25 PM)_

**Mica** _(02-Jul-18 06:26 PM)_

> Ohhh! There was some in your closet!

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 06:26 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Ibraxas get out of the costume and check what is happening in the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 06:26 PM)_

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 06:26 PM)_

_Emmett's fur has completely darkened._

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 06:26 PM)_

**Finna Steel Christmas** _(02-Jul-18 06:26 PM)_

_Steely whispers in Asier's ear._

@Magic8Ball Do you like corn.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 06:27 PM)_

_Garrick strolls up to a gift shop._

> Cashier. What's your most valueable item?

🎱 | Astounding yes, Tom Thompson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 07:03 PM)_

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 07:03 PM)_

_Garrick begins unloading some hostages from his pockets._

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 07:04 PM)_

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 07:05 PM)_

> There aren't a lot of ghosts on Earth.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 07:09 PM)_

> Here you go, Seth.
> Airlock them.

_Garrick hands Seth a mound of Erizoalan cubs._

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 07:09 PM)_

> Ahhhh, the first airlock of the ship!

**Tom Thompson** _(02-Jul-18 07:10 PM)_

> I, the Mickey Mouse Ghost, shall steal your gold and leave you goldless and poor!

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 07:10 PM)_

> No gold here.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 07:10 PM)_

> Go away.

_Garrick sprays an anti-spectral spray bottle at the MMG._

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 07:10 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett get up and browse through the rooms?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 07:10 PM)_

🎱 | Yeah, Zander.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 07:11 PM)_

_Emmett's muscles begin to relax as he begins to exit his crave._

> I feel a little better.
> Still shitty.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 07:11 PM)_

> Now what should I do with the women...

**Tom Thompson** _(02-Jul-18 07:11 PM)_

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost hisses and flies away._

> I was dead for a while. What is it that I can steal that you have expensive

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 07:11 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Ibraxas fix the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 07:11 PM)_

🎱 | Yay, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 07:11 PM)_

> Um the slaves.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 07:11 PM)_

> Yeah.

**Tom Thompson** _(02-Jul-18 07:12 PM)_

> Um, the slates?

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 07:12 PM)_

_Ibraxas pats Emmett's shrinking shoulder._

> I'm going out to fix the ship. Don't do anything dumb while I'm gone.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 07:12 PM)_

> I'll try not to kill everyone.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 07:12 PM)_

> I'll probably do something dumb.
> Alright. Slaves. Do you all speak GU Binary?

**Tom Thompson** _(02-Jul-18 07:13 PM)_

> The slates... pardon me, I can't say bad words as a Micky mouse ghost.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 07:13 PM)_

> `Slave`: Uimh.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 07:13 PM)_

> Hey Seth?

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 07:14 PM)_

> Yeah Emmett?

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 07:14 PM)_

_Garrick grimaces._

> Someone else can have you.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 07:15 PM)_

> What would happen if I stayed like this?

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 07:15 PM)_

> You'd probably be stronger and more manly.

**Tom Thompson** _(02-Jul-18 07:15 PM)_

> Are the slates really all you have that I can steal?
> Also, what color are the slates?

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 07:17 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do we arrive at Rawney's Restaurant?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 07:17 PM)_

🎱 | Resounding no, Bagelwrecker.

**RPretribution** _(02-Jul-18 07:17 PM)_

@Magic8Ball does garrick go to a room

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 07:17 PM)_

> I don't have a communicator anymore either.

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett take a piss?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 07:17 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 07:18 PM)_

> If you can deal with an older version, I got one for you to use.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 07:18 PM)_

_Ibraxas ascends the stairs, covered in oil and plasma._

> I'm back from fixing the ship. It really wasn't that bad.

**Tom Thompson** _(02-Jul-18 07:18 PM)_

@Magic8Ball do I make the ship go to Earth's Disneyland?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 07:18 PM)_

🎱 | Lowercase no, Tom Thompson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(02-Jul-18 07:18 PM)_

> But comms are really expensive, like 30,000 ducketts expensive.

**Zander** _(02-Jul-18 07:19 PM)_

> Fine.

**Brakia** _(02-Jul-18 07:19 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Ibraxas sit down and take off his robo arm?

**Magic8Ball** _(02-Jul-18 07:19 PM)_

🎱 | Likely no, Brakia.

**Tom Thompson** _(02-Jul-18 07:20 PM)_
