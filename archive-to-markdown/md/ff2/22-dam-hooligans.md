t!8ball Did Seth manage to call up a friend to send in a stronger, more resilient replacement chassis for the Panty Slingshot and get it mostly intact after a couple of equinoxes?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:45 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:45 PM)_

t!8ball Is Emmett currently idling around the campfire?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:45 PM)_

> 🎱 | Don't count on it, Zander.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:46 PM)_

_Emmett sits away from the campfire, plucking grass out of the ground._

> Y'know, this planet is comfy.

_He tightens Seth's oversized fur coat._

> Lush grass, forests for miles.

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 02:46 PM)_

t!8ball does Lucian walk out to say hi?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:46 PM)_

> 🎱 | My reply is yes, Arky.

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 02:46 PM)_

_Lucian emerges from the ship's busted cryosleep chamber, walks over to Emmett, and sits down in the grass._

> Hey, guys.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:46 PM)_

> Oh! Lucian.

_Emmett scoots over slightly in Lucian's direction._

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:47 PM)_

_Deyner leaps over Lucian and into the dirt opposite of him._

> Hello! I believe we haven't met!

_Deyner spits out dirt._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:47 PM)_

_Seth holds a stick with a boar's snout attached._

> Yeah, reminds me a lot of my home planet.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:47 PM)_

_Garrick stares blanky at the bright sun._

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 02:47 PM)_

> Lucian Blackwater, nice to meet you.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:48 PM)_

_Deyner holds his hand out to Lucian._

> Deyner Revathen.

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 02:48 PM)_

_Lucian shakes his hand._

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:48 PM)_

_Deyner shakes his other hand, crossing his arms over._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:48 PM)_

> We need to work on getting power on in the ship soon.

_Seth pulls the pin on an anxiety grenade and chucks it behind him._

> Dades is a great ship replacement guy, but we're a hundred thousand Ducketts in debt to him now. Getting the ship up and running would've been another hundred thousand.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 02:48 PM)_

_Hector is shocked to see Lucian awake!_

> He wakes at last!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:48 PM)_

> I'm getting tired of walking around in the dark to get to my room.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:48 PM)_

_Garrick turns and looks at the needless explosion._

> Okay, that was loud.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:49 PM)_

_Emmett swirls around on his butt to look at Seth._

> What?
> In the dark?

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:49 PM)_

> Yeah, in the dark.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:49 PM)_

> It's the middle of the day.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 02:49 PM)_

> My name is Hector.

_Hector holds all six arms out, and then laughs to himself._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:49 PM)_

> Great observation Garrick.

_Seth chucks the roasted boar snout at Garrick, where it gets swallowed by his pockets._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:50 PM)_

> I'm assuming we're out of backup power in the ship?

_Emmett walks over and sits on a log next to Seth._

_He grabs a rodent corpse from Sanya's game pile and plunges a stick into it._

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:50 PM)_

_Deyner looks at Lucian's weapon and drools a bit in awe._

> Woah! Nice weapon, who made this?

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:50 PM)_

> Yeah.
> At night, it gets way too dark in that damn ship.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:51 PM)_

> I haven't been in the ship this whole time.
> So, I wouldn't know.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:51 PM)_

_Garrick pokes his head between Seth and Emmett's._

> Wouldn't it get hot in there?

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:51 PM)_

> Perhaps if you were to add new lights to the ship? The current ones are kinda old.

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 02:51 PM)_

_Lucian unsheaths his weapon._

> My father did; a scythe made of the strongest metal found on our planet.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:52 PM)_

> Lights were changed out before we got the ship.

_Seth shrugs._

> Power is out, though. We just need a new battery, Kyle's didn't last very long.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:52 PM)_

*Emmett gives Seth a puzzled look.*

> We were using KYL's battery to power the ship?

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:52 PM)_

> Hmmm... if you want, I could check it out!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 02:52 PM)_

t!8ball Does Danny exit the ship and join the others around the campfire?

t!8ball Does Deyner look on a makeshift map of the planet?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:53 PM)_

> 🎱 | Better not tell you now, Deyner.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 02:53 PM)_

_Danny exits the ship and begins his morning stretches._

> Hello, world!

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:54 PM)_

*Deyner gives a small wave to Danny, tired of handshaking for the time being.*

> Hello...

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:54 PM)_

> I'm currently cooking a... rodent... thing...

*Emmett tilts his head at the meat.*

> The berries here are extremely tart.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:54 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth sit back and play with his lighter?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:54 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, Bagelwrecker.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:54 PM)_

> Do you think we could cook a rubber squeaky toy?

*Garrick takes out a squeaky toy and starts to honk it in Chomsky's ear deliberately.*

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 02:54 PM)_

> Brilliant. Meat is a great part of a balanced meal!

> So is rubber... but I may be biased.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

> Do you have one?

_Emmett obviously doesn't know what rubber is._

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

_Deyner gives a mild look at the mention of meat._

> Eh... it's alright.

_Deyner thinks about tossing a salad for lunch..._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

> Also, be on the look out for a drow elf, she kinda wants to kill me.

_Seth looks around in paranoia, then throws a nasty glance at Deyner._

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

_Deyner looks offended!_

> Hey! I'm half Drow!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

t!8ball does Garrick pull out a rubber squeaky toy and show Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

> 🎱 | It is decidedly so, RPretribution.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

_Emmett beholds the squeaky toy, grimacing at its creepy clown-like appearance._

> That's disturbing.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

_Garrick continues honking the squeaky toy in various people's ears._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

> Where did you keep that?

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

> I don't think anyone really wants to know.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

> In my pockets, duh.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

> His butt.

> ...Do ghosts have butts?

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

> No.

_Garrick stares deep into Deyner's eyes._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett take the rodent and lay the stick on his legs to cool off?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

> 🎱 | Very doubtful, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

> Well unfortunately, I don't care if you're half drow. I'm killing the first female drow I see on this planet.

> We could have meat for a couple days if we kill one, too.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:58 PM)_

> I'll freeze you before that happens.

_Deyner puffs cold air in Seth's direction._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:58 PM)_

_Emmett grimaces at the thought of eating another sentient being._

> Cannibalism isn't really an option.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 02:58 PM)_

> Okay, calm down, you two!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:58 PM)_

> Seth, you're even more desperate than usual.
> Except this time, for food.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:58 PM)_

_Seth flicks a booger at Deyner nonchalantly._

> Yes, freeze me because I defend myself. I don't want to deal with a dumb drow assassin tailing my ass.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:58 PM)_

> My bad... I thought you were talking about eating me.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:59 PM)_

> We have enough people, we could easily defend ourselves against a single assassin.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

> Not a problem.
> Drow assassins are different though, cunning as hell and stealthy as fuck.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

*Emmett gives a grim expression.*

> Sounds like the Llamanians.

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 3:00 PM)_

> So, what happened? Last thing I remember is meeting a woman-horse thing.

*Lucian takes out his scythe and tosses it in the air, grabbing it by its handle.*

> Deyner, would you be interested in a spar with me?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

> Except, not exactly stealthy...

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

*Deyner smirks.*

> Then make it to where they can't hide, dummy!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

> Actually, I don't think they're at all alike.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

> Sure...

*Deyner looks around for his swords.*

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

*Seth scoffs at Deyner and scratches his stubbled chin.*

> Willing to degrade their bodies in exchange for a kill...

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

*Hector butts in on the conversation, resting himself around the fire with the others.*

> It doesn't matter how stealthy they are, my drone can spot them!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:01 PM)_

*Chomsky opens his eyes and holds his head from his hangover from the prior night. He happened to fall asleep around the campfire.*

> Hey guys...  What are we talking about?

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:01 PM)_

> Oh, you know. The banking system.

*Deyner rolls his eyes.*

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:01 PM)_

*Chomsky tenses his brow.*

> Uh-huh.

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 03:01 PM)_

*Lucian readies his blade.*

> You ready?

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:02 PM)_

*Hector watches Lucian, unsure why he has his scythe out.*

> Ready for what?

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:02 PM)_

*Chomsky groans.*

> No, seriously...
> What's going on?

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:02 PM)_

*Deyner finds his swords lying on the ground and grabs them, readying them for the battle ahead.*

> I don't know, are you?

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:02 PM)_

*Garrick takes out some pom-poms and cheers with them.*

> C'mon, guys! Let's go kill all the natives!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:02 PM)_

*Danny salivates, always hungry for more food.*

> I just wanted the squirrel...

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:03 PM)_

*Hector puts two sets of arms on his hips.*

> Why don't we hunt animals instead of hunting the natives?

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:03 PM)_

> We can do both!

*Garrick raises a pom-pom in excitement.*

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:03 PM)_

*Danny groans.*

> Natives are usually bland anyways. I agree with Hector.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:03 PM)_

*Chomsky stares at Garrick with a sorrowful expression.*

> You guys are harsh.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:03 PM)_

> We're stranded on a random planet, Chonko.
> Need to feed the tum tum.

*Garrick pats his body.*

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

> I can see that!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

> So? What's the problem, then?

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

> My drone could probably knock out enough animals to get food, guys.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does the Drow assassin show up?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, Deyner.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

> Why are going to kill natives?!

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

*Deyner examines his blades and holds out a finger.*

> One second, gotta sharpen these up.

*He takes out a large dremal and starts to sharpen his swords.*

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

> We don't need to Chomsky, we can just hunt!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:05 PM)_

*Emmett picks up the cooked rodent and looks over to Danny.*

> Danny, want to share?

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:05 PM)_

*Dannys licks his lips in anticipation.*

> Whatever works.
> I would like that very much.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:05 PM)_

*Hector takes out a drone.*

> What we need is someone with a strong enough filter in their mask to handle the gas while I knock out animals using my drones...

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:06 PM)_

> Wait, what gas?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:06 PM)_

*Emmett rips the rodent body in half and hands over a half to Danny.*

> Here.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:06 PM)_

*Hector shrugs.*

> Oh that's kind of my thing. Nothing lethal, just puts you to sleep for a while...
> At least nothing lethal in my drones.

*Hector laughs.*

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:07 PM)_

*Danny grabs the rodent and practically inhales it, leaving only the bones left after a couple of seconds.*

> I very much appreciate it.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:07 PM)_

*Deyner stops sharpening his swords.*

> If you give me the materials, I can make some masks.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:07 PM)_

*Emmett gasps in awe at Danny's display of carnal hunger.*

> No problem....

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:07 PM)_

*Danny belches loudly.*

> You'll find plenty of plastic in my room...

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:07 PM)_

> I doubt we can find enough to make one for everyone, we'll need more money for that

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:07 PM)_

*Instead of entertaining Lucians attempt to spar, Deyner starts to head back to the ship.*

_Emmett snaps in quick succession towards his crewmates._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:11 PM)_

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:11 PM)_

_Deyner takes off his gloves._

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 03:11 PM)_

_Lucian hands it to him._

> Of course.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:12 PM)_

> And of course, half of you aren't paying attention to the topic at hand.

_Emmett face palms._

> Damnit.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:13 PM)_

_Danny stands up on a nearby large rock for an announcement._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:13 PM)_

_Garrick nearly tosses his food away in excitement._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:14 PM)_
