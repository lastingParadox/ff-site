**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:45 PM)_

t!8ball Did Seth manage to call up a friend to send in a stronger, more resilient replacement chassis for the Panty Slingshot and get it mostly intact after a couple of equinoxes?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:45 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:45 PM)_

t!8ball Is Emmett currently idling around the campfire?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:45 PM)_

> 🎱 | Don't count on it, Zander.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:46 PM)_

_Emmett sits away from the campfire, plucking grass out of the ground._

> Y'know, this planet is comfy.

_He tightens Seth's oversized fur coat._

> Lush grass, forests for miles.

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 02:46 PM)_

t!8ball does Lucian walk out to say hi?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:46 PM)_

> 🎱 | My reply is yes, Arky.

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 02:46 PM)_

_Lucian emerges from the ship's busted cryosleep chamber, walks over to Emmett, and sits down in the grass._

> Hey, guys.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:46 PM)_

> Oh! Lucian.

_Emmett scoots over slightly in Lucian's direction._

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:47 PM)_

_Deyner leaps over Lucian and into the dirt opposite of him._

> Hello! I believe we haven't met!

_Deyner spits out dirt._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:47 PM)_

_Seth holds a stick with a boar's snout attached._

> Yeah, reminds me a lot of my home planet.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:47 PM)_

_Garrick stares blanky at the bright sun._

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 02:47 PM)_

> Lucian Blackwater, nice to meet you.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:48 PM)_

_Deyner holds his hand out to Lucian._

> Deyner Revathen.

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 02:48 PM)_

_Lucian shakes his hand._

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:48 PM)_

_Deyner shakes his other hand, crossing his arms over._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:48 PM)_

> We need to work on getting power on in the ship soon.

_Seth pulls the pin on an anxiety grenade and chucks it behind him._

> Dades is a great ship replacement guy, but we're a hundred thousand Ducketts in debt to him now. Getting the ship up and running would've been another hundred thousand.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 02:48 PM)_

_Hector is shocked to see Lucian awake!_

> He wakes at last!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:48 PM)_

> I'm getting tired of walking around in the dark to get to my room.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:48 PM)_

_Garrick turns and looks at the needless explosion._

> Okay, that was loud.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:49 PM)_

_Emmett swirls around on his butt to look at Seth._

> What?
> In the dark?

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:49 PM)_

> Yeah, in the dark.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:49 PM)_

> It's the middle of the day.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 02:49 PM)_

> My name is Hector.

_Hector holds all six arms out, and then laughs to himself._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:49 PM)_

> Great observation Garrick.

_Seth chucks the roasted boar snout at Garrick, where it gets swallowed by his pockets._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:50 PM)_

> I'm assuming we're out of backup power in the ship?

_Emmett walks over and sits on a log next to Seth._

_He grabs a rodent corpse from Sanya's game pile and plunges a stick into it._

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:50 PM)_

_Deyner looks at Lucian's weapon and drools a bit in awe._

> Woah! Nice weapon, who made this?

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:50 PM)_

> Yeah.
> At night, it gets way too dark in that damn ship.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:51 PM)_

> I haven't been in the ship this whole time.
> So, I wouldn't know.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:51 PM)_

_Garrick pokes his head between Seth and Emmett's._

> Wouldn't it get hot in there?

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:51 PM)_

> Perhaps if you were to add new lights to the ship? The current ones are kinda old.

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 02:51 PM)_

_Lucian unsheaths his weapon._

> My father did; a scythe made of the strongest metal found on our planet.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:52 PM)_

> Lights were changed out before we got the ship.

_Seth shrugs._

> Power is out, though. We just need a new battery, Kyle's didn't last very long.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:52 PM)_

_Emmett gives Seth a puzzled look._

> We were using KYL's battery to power the ship?

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:52 PM)_

> Hmmm... if you want, I could check it out!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 02:52 PM)_

t!8ball Does Danny exit the ship and join the others around the campfire?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:52 PM)_

> 🎱 | Yes, definitely, Platinum_Pathos.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:53 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner look on a makeshift map of the planet?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:53 PM)_

> 🎱 | Better not tell you now, Deyner.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 02:53 PM)_

_Danny exits the ship and begins his morning stretches._

> Hello, world!

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:54 PM)_

_Deyner gives a small wave to Danny, tired of handshaking for the time being._

> Hello...

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:54 PM)_

> I'm currently cooking a... rodent... thing...

_Emmett tilts his head at the meat._

> The berries here are extremely tart.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:54 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth sit back and play with his lighter?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:54 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, Bagelwrecker.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:54 PM)_

> Do you think we could cook a rubber squeaky toy?

_Garrick takes out a squeaky toy and starts to honk it in Chomsky's ear deliberately._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 02:54 PM)_

> Brilliant. Meat is a great part of a balanced meal!

> So is rubber... but I may be biased.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

> Do you have one?

_Emmett obviously doesn't know what rubber is._

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

_Deyner gives a mild look at the mention of meat._

> Eh... it's alright.

_Deyner thinks about tossing a salad for lunch..._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

> Also, be on the look out for a drow elf, she kinda wants to kill me.

_Seth looks around in paranoia, then throws a nasty glance at Deyner._

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

_Deyner looks offended!_

> Hey! I'm half Drow!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

t!8ball does Garrick pull out a rubber squeaky toy and show Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

> 🎱 | It is decidedly so, RPretribution.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

_Emmett beholds the squeaky toy, grimacing at its creepy clown-like appearance._

> That's disturbing.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:55 PM)_

_Garrick continues honking the squeaky toy in various people's ears._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

> Where did you keep that?

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

> I don't think anyone really wants to know.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

> In my pockets, duh.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

> His butt.

> ...Do ghosts have butts?

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

> No.

_Garrick stares deep into Deyner's eyes._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett take the rodent and lay the stick on his legs to cool off?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

> 🎱 | Very doubtful, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:56 PM)_

> Well unfortunately, I don't care if you're half drow. I'm killing the first female drow I see on this planet.

> We could have meat for a couple days if we kill one, too.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:58 PM)_

> I'll freeze you before that happens.

_Deyner puffs cold air in Seth's direction._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 02:58 PM)_

_Emmett grimaces at the thought of eating another sentient being._

> Cannibalism isn't really an option.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 02:58 PM)_

> Okay, calm down, you two!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:58 PM)_

> Seth, you're even more desperate than usual.
> Except this time, for food.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 02:58 PM)_

_Seth flicks a booger at Deyner nonchalantly._

> Yes, freeze me because I defend myself. I don't want to deal with a dumb drow assassin tailing my ass.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 02:58 PM)_

> My bad... I thought you were talking about eating me.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 02:59 PM)_

> We have enough people, we could easily defend ourselves against a single assassin.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

> Not a problem.
> Drow assassins are different though, cunning as hell and stealthy as fuck.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

_Emmett gives a grim expression._

> Sounds like the Llamanians.

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 3:00 PM)_

> So, what happened? Last thing I remember is meeting a woman-horse thing.

_Lucian takes out his scythe and tosses it in the air, grabbing it by its handle._

> Deyner, would you be interested in a spar with me?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

> Except, not exactly stealthy...

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

_Deyner smirks._

> Then make it to where they can't hide, dummy!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

> Actually, I don't think they're at all alike.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

> Sure...

_Deyner looks around for his swords._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

_Seth scoffs at Deyner and scratches his stubbled chin._

> Willing to degrade their bodies in exchange for a kill...

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:00 PM)_

_Hector butts in on the conversation, resting himself around the fire with the others._

> It doesn't matter how stealthy they are, my drone can spot them!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:01 PM)_

_Chomsky opens his eyes and holds his head from his hangover from the prior night. He happened to fall asleep around the campfire._

> Hey guys... What are we talking about?

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:01 PM)_

> Oh, you know. The banking system.

_Deyner rolls his eyes._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:01 PM)_

_Chomsky tenses his brow._

> Uh-huh.

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 03:01 PM)_

_Lucian readies his blade._

> You ready?

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:02 PM)_

_Hector watches Lucian, unsure why he has his scythe out._

> Ready for what?

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:02 PM)_

_Chomsky groans._

> No, seriously...
> What's going on?

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:02 PM)_

_Deyner finds his swords lying on the ground and grabs them, readying them for the battle ahead._

> I don't know, are you?

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:02 PM)_

_Garrick takes out some pom-poms and cheers with them._

> C'mon, guys! Let's go kill all the natives!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:02 PM)_

_Danny salivates, always hungry for more food._

> I just wanted the squirrel...

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:03 PM)_

_Hector puts two sets of arms on his hips._

> Why don't we hunt animals instead of hunting the natives?

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:03 PM)_

> We can do both!

_Garrick raises a pom-pom in excitement._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:03 PM)_

_Danny groans._

> Natives are usually bland anyways. I agree with Hector.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:03 PM)_

_Chomsky stares at Garrick with a sorrowful expression._

> You guys are harsh.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:03 PM)_

> We're stranded on a random planet, Chonko.
> Need to feed the tum tum.

_Garrick pats his body._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

> I can see that!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

> So? What's the problem, then?

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

> My drone could probably knock out enough animals to get food, guys.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does the Drow assassin show up?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, Deyner.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

> Why are going to kill natives?!

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

_Deyner examines his blades and holds out a finger._

> One second, gotta sharpen these up.

_He takes out a large dremal and starts to sharpen his swords._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:04 PM)_

> We don't need to Chomsky, we can just hunt!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:05 PM)_

_Emmett picks up the cooked rodent and looks over to Danny._

> Danny, want to share?

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:05 PM)_

_Dannys licks his lips in anticipation._

> Whatever works.
> I would like that very much.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:05 PM)_

_Hector takes out a drone._

> What we need is someone with a strong enough filter in their mask to handle the gas while I knock out animals using my drones...

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:06 PM)_

> Wait, what gas?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:06 PM)_

_Emmett rips the rodent body in half and hands over a half to Danny._

> Here.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:06 PM)_

_Hector shrugs._

> Oh that's kind of my thing. Nothing lethal, just puts you to sleep for a while...
> At least nothing lethal in my drones.

_Hector laughs._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:07 PM)_

_Danny grabs the rodent and practically inhales it, leaving only the bones left after a couple of seconds._

> I very much appreciate it.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:07 PM)_

_Deyner stops sharpening his swords._

> If you give me the materials, I can make some masks.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:07 PM)_

_Emmett gasps in awe at Danny's display of carnal hunger._

> No problem....

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:07 PM)_

_Danny belches loudly._

> You'll find plenty of plastic in my room...

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:07 PM)_

> I doubt we can find enough to make one for everyone, we'll need more money for that

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:07 PM)_

_Instead of entertaining Lucian's attempt to spar, Deyner starts to head back to the ship._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:08 PM)_

_Emmett holds his rodent half with his two index digits, not wanting to get himself messy._

> Seth, can you hand me a napkin or something?

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:08 PM)_

> I already have a mask.

_Garrick grabs his mask with a finger and snaps it back on his own face._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:08 PM)_

> Yeah, sure.

_Seth reaches his arm out to Garrick, grabbing at his vest._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:08 PM)_

_Garrick doesn't notice Seth's hand touching him._

> It's great.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:08 PM)_

> We can always steal the materials??

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:08 PM)_

_Garrick raises a pom-pom in excitement._

> Now you're talking!

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:08 PM)_

t!8ball Does hector go with Deyner to help him design a gas mask strong enough to withstand his gas?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:08 PM)_

🎱 | Don't count on it, MultiTheDuck.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:08 PM)_

_Chomsky is beginning to lose interest in the others' scheme to gas a bunch of animals. He folds his arms and rolls his eyes._

> Materials from where, exactly?

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:08 PM)_

_Danny belches._

> Why would you steal my materials if I just offered them?
> Did you guys even hear me? I said I have a bunch of plastic just strewn about my room.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:08 PM)_

> Plus we don't all need a mask, Garrick is immune to pathogens after all.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:09 PM)_

_Garrick blows a raspberry._

> You don't know that.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:09 PM)_

_Hector sits by the fire and watches as Deyner heads to his workshop._

> Okay let me know how that goes Deyner. Come to me if you need any chemicals.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:09 PM)_

_Deyner mumbles loudly as he gets to the worktable._

> And my frost blood makes any pathogens that enter my body grow slowly...

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:09 PM)_

_Chomsky scoffs._

> So you'll still die, just more slowly. Great.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:10 PM)_

_Hector takes out his knockout dart and admires the vial inside of its translucent casing._

> It's not exactly a pathogen, not this dart at least...

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:10 PM)_

_Garrick notices Seth digging in his pockets and he quickly flies away from him. He puts his hands on his hips._

> Hey, hands off!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:10 PM)_

_Before Garrick got away, Seth was able to grab a napkin from the ghost's pockets._

> Here Emmett. Garrick's ass napkin. Nice and warm.

_Seth hands over the napkin to Emmett._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:10 PM)_

_Emmett grabs the napkin and uses it to hold his cooked morsel._

> Uhm, Okay then.
> Thanks.

_Emmett picks at the morsel with his teeth, taking small bites at a time._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:10 PM)_

_Hector tosses Deyner the dart._

> Just don't break this, that would be bad.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:10 PM)_

_Deyner stumbles forward and manages to catch the dart._

> Not necessarily. If we get out in enough time we can make up a cure.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:10 PM)_

> Hey. All of you.

_He snaps in quick succession towards his crewmates, a half-eaten morsel still in his grasp._

> We need money.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:11 PM)_

_Garrick jerks his head at the sound._

> Huh?

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:11 PM)_

_Seth groans._

> We know.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:11 PM)_

> Yes, we do.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:11 PM)_

> How are we going to get some?

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:11 PM)_

> Honestly...

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:11 PM)_

> I gotta piss, though.

_Seth begins jumping around, clutching his groin._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:11 PM)_

_Emmett chucks the bones off the rocky terrain._

> I just want to put that into your minds.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:11 PM)_

> And Lucian, may I see your sycthe?

_Deyner takes off his gloves._

**Arky** _(07-Oct-18 03:11 PM)_

_Lucian hands his scythe to him._

> Of course.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:12 PM)_

> And of course, half of you aren't paying attention to the topic at hand.

_Emmett facepalms._

> Damnit.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:13 PM)_

_Danny stands up on a nearby large rock for an announcement._

> Guys, we are quite simply out of delectable food!
> Unfortunately, we need money for that though.
> I vote we find a way to make money.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:13 PM)_

_Emmett speaks with his mouth full._

> Ducketths spethifically.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:13 PM)_

> I vote we find a way to steal money!

_Garrick nearly tosses his food away in excitement._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:13 PM)_

> I vote too.

_Seth pulls out a judge's score sign with a '10' on it._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:13 PM)_

t!choose Everyone gets 1/16th of a burger from Garrick's pocket | the campfire spreads to Emmett's feet

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:13 PM)_

🤔 | PlasmaPerson, I pick: the campfire spreads to Emmett's feet!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:13 PM)_

> Any means necessary.

_Danny pumps his fist in the air._

> For the food!!!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:13 PM)_

_Emmett doesn't notice the fire and rolls his eyes at Danny._

> You garbage gut.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:14 PM)_

> Dude, the campfire's getting you.

_Chomsky takes a bite like nothing is wrong._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:14 PM)_

> I can go hunting. Probably wouldn't be as effective as if had my drone, but I could probably find some decent animals.

_Hector suddenly realizes that Emmett's on fire._

> Emmett! Get away from the fire!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:14 PM)_

_Emmett takes one last bite out of his morsel and looks down to his hoof._

> Shit.

_He starts to stamp out his hoof._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:15 PM)_

t!8ball Is Danny out of food in his room?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:15 PM)_

> 🎱 | You may rely on it, Platinum_Pathos.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:15 PM)_

_Danny looks at the pile of crumbs where there used to be food and scowls._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:15 PM)_

_Emmett successfully extinguishes the fire on his leg._

> Should we steal Ducketts?

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:15 PM)_

_Chomsky shrugs._

> Sounds like a plan to me.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:16 PM)_

> From where?

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:16 PM)_

_Garrick peers out into the valley below._

> Let's go look for civilization.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner start crafting a prototype mask?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:16 PM)_

🎱 | Better not tell you now, Deyner.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:16 PM)_

> I'd prefer to stay on the positive side of the law, but if it's the only way...

_Danny jumps from the rock he's standing on._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick head off in a random direction?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:16 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, RPretribution.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:16 PM)_

> Come on, let's goooooooo!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:17 PM)_

_Emmett eyeballs Danny and tosses the bones from his food off the cliff._

> I don't think there's a GU down here, buddies.

_He slides down the cliff after Garrick, with the rest of the crew following suit._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:17 PM)_

> Oh geez'!

_Chomsky stumbles at the end of his slide, nearly falling over._

> Garrick, you're gonna get us all lost!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:17 PM)_

> Neither do I.

_Seth dusts off his jeans._

> I think we're right below jurisdiction!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:17 PM)_

_Garrick waves the others down._

> Hurry up!

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:17 PM)_

> I guess I'm not hunting then, okay!

_Once he's finished sliding, Hector raises his legs up and scorpion runs on his arms after Garrick._

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:18 PM)_

_Deep in his craft, Deyner slams his table with his hammer, frustrated that he's unable to attach some parts of his mask together._

> Gods fucking dammit why won't this thing work!?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:18 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett put on his goggles as he follows Garrick?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:18 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, definitely, Zander.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:18 PM)_

> Wait up, you stupid ghost!

_Chomsky runs off after Garrick towards a river._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:18 PM)_

_Emmett calibrates his VIZO-2480 goggles and picks up some readings on organic lifeforms in the distance._

> I think I can see something ahead...

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:18 PM)_

t!8ball Did Seth remember to grab his backpack?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:18 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:18 PM)_

_Seth, in the back of the group with Emmett, watches as he messes with the goggles._

> You wanna hike it, Emmett?

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:19 PM)_

> I'd like to bring up that we have no plan whatsoever, nor a place to steal Ducketts from!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:19 PM)_

> Yeah. It's about a kilometer out in... that direction.

_Emmett points in a direction a bit right of where Garrick is headed._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:20 PM)_

_Once he catches up to Garrick, Hector lowers his legs and picks his torso back up._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:20 PM)_

_Seth cups his hands over his mouth to make sure Garrick hears him._

> We can probably make it in like ten minutes if we don't run it.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:20 PM)_

> Then let's hurry up and get on with it!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:20 PM)_

_Emmett stratches his wrist, a bit anxious over the prospect of stealing from the locals._

> Yeah, let's go.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:21 PM)_

_Chomsky's mouth gets slapped by Garrick as the spectre pivots in the direction Emmett mentioned. He furrows his brows and screams an Zielic obscenity._

> @ԗݛ$ɍȝ$ɍȽ!

_Zielic Translation: Snoteater!_

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:21 PM)_

_Danny looks back at the camp on the cliff behind them._

> So is anyone staying behind, or are we all headed out?

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:21 PM)_

> I hope we find a place that sells space weed or cigarettes...
> I'm dying without a good smoke.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:21 PM)_

_Emmett speaks into his watch._

> Come on, Iris!

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:22 PM)_

> I guess Deyner is staying to make his mask.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:22 PM)_

_Iris emerges from the ship, tripping as she rushes down the cliff to reach the others. She exclaims into her wrist, partially exhausted despite her long nap._

> Where are we going?!

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:22 PM)_

> Hey guys, I finished one up!

_He shakes newly completed mask in the air excitedly and puts it down to work on the next one._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:22 PM)_

_Chomsky rolls his eyes after Emmett got Iris to follow them._

> Emmett, I'm going to scream in your ear one day.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:22 PM)_

> @ݛȽȽҐ. Śݛԗ'$ Þɍ ȝ ҜɍȽƟ ȝÞݛǼ$ Ͼ$.

_Zielic Translation: Sorry. Don't be a jerk about it._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:22 PM)_

> I feel like food may be slightly more important than drugs, Seth.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:23 PM)_

> But not in a rocket ship...

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:23 PM)_

_Seth shrugs at Danny's comment._

> Meh, we can get some of that too.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:23 PM)_

_Emmett grabs ahold of Iris's hand once she catches up and moves ahead of the others._

> C'mon, you sleepyhead!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:23 PM)_

_Chomsky wrings a finger in his ear, trying to understand Garrick's Zielic response._

> My toast is a little crusty?

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:23 PM)_

_Garrick flips Chomsky off._

> This is what I mean.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:23 PM)_

_Deyner's stomach grumbles._

> Ugh, hungry...

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:23 PM)_

> But you didn't answer-

_Iris sighs as she's dragged ahead._

> Oh, alright.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:23 PM)_

_Seth pushes Danny forward._

> Don't need to get left behind, do we?

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:24 PM)_

_Chomsky rolls his eyes._

> Riiiight...

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:24 PM)_

_Danny picks up the pace after being prodded by Seth._

> Fine, onwards!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:24 PM)_

_Emmett stops and admires Iris's face for a bit._

> Want a piggyback ride?

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:24 PM)_

_Iris chuckles._

> Yes.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:24 PM)_

_Seth scoffs at the lovers' overt affection._

> I can give you a piggyback ride, minus the piggyback...

_He violently pushes his index finger in and out of his clasped hand._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:24 PM)_

_Emmett crouches down, his tail wagging._

> Hop on then!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:24 PM)_

_Danny looks away from Seth in disgust._

> I'll just ignore those comments.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:25 PM)_

_Iris gets onto Emmett's back and leans her chin onto his horns as he stands up._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:25 PM)_

_Garrick sighs as he continues leading the others._

> Ͼ ïϾƟɍŚ $ɷɍ ݛ$ɷɍȽ ӴǼҐ. ɷɍ ǼԗŚɍȽ@$ݛݛŚ Њɍ.

_Zielic Translation: I liked the other guy. He understood me._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:25 PM)_

_Danny huffs as Iris piggybacks Emmett._

> It's only a kilometer...

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:26 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick find something of interest?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:26 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook not so good, RPretribution.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:26 PM)_

_Seth speeds up, walking directly behind Emmett and Iris._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:26 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew finally get there?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:26 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, Zander.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:27 PM)_

_Hector takes out his drone controller._

> Garrick hold up, I could probably get a aerial view with my drone if you want to stand still for a second...

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:27 PM)_

> Ɣɷݛ'@ $ɷɍ ݛ$ɷɍȽ ӴǼҐ?

_Zielic Translation: Who's the other guy?_

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:27 PM)_

_Upon finishing another mask, Deyner looks up from his craft table and finds no one else._

> Where did everybody go?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:27 PM)_

_Emmett exhales, not used to carrying Iris around for longer distances._

> That kilometer felt longer than it should have.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:28 PM)_

_Danny laughs._

> I think you just need to work out more.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:28 PM)_

_Emmett realizes he's sweating. His sides and back are getting quite hot._

> Iris, you're pretty warm right now.
> Like, unusually.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:28 PM)_

_Deyner shrugs and puts his masks down._

> Time for some mischief, I guess.

_Deyner sneaks into the ship and accesses Iris's tablet in her room._

> Perfect...

_He snoops around her messages and finds a mix of lewd pictures and texts between her and Emmett._

> Oh my...

_Deyner laughs sinisterly as he prints out some pictures and plasters them around Emmett's room._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:28 PM)_

t!choose Town | Stream | Giant Dam | Portside City | town next to stream | Beach | Old Campsite | Burnt Down forest | Mountainside town

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:28 PM)_

🤔 | Bagelwrecker, I pick Stream!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:29 PM)_

> Ͼ $ɷϾԗƟ ɷϾ@ ԗȝЊɍ Ɣȝ@ ȝЭЭɍȽ.

_Zielic Translation: I think his name was Azzer._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:29 PM)_

_Hector raises an eyebrow as he grabs his drone and turns it on._

> I'm sorry, I don't speak ghost.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:29 PM)_

_Chomsky looks at his reflection, scowls, and kicks the water._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:29 PM)_

_Iris turns pink._

> My bad... it's probably related to these veins...

_Iris hangs her hands in front of Emmett's face, showing off her wrists. The veins pulsate red and orange._

> They've been almost glowing all day...

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:29 PM)_

_Dannys giggles to himself._

> Guns are more effective, Chomsky.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:30 PM)_

_Seth sniffs his shoulder and nearly gags._

> Meh, I need a bath.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:30 PM)_

_After getting tired of posting images of Emmett's cock around his own room, Deyner decides to be helpful and starts to fix various appliances around the ship._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:30 PM)_

_Emmett dips his hooves into the stream and looks down its length._

> I think this stream leads to a dam, considering how deep this water gets.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:30 PM)_

_Chomsky turns his scowl to Danny, but then looks away._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:30 PM)_

_As Seth starts to take off his shirt, Danny grabs onto Seth in disapproval._

> We didn't bring soap dude.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:30 PM)_

_Seth sneers at Danny and lets go of his shirt._

> It's possible.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:30 PM)_

> Okay, let's see if I can find anything...

_Hector tosses his drone up in the air and it begins to float up_

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:30 PM)_

> Should we follow the stream?

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:30 PM)_

_Garrick floats, following the stream for a bit before finding the dam in the distance._

> Yeah, looks to be a dam. Hope we can find something useful.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:31 PM)_

_Emmett smiles up at Iris and heads down the stream._

> Yeah, we'll go.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:31 PM)_

_Iris's eyes sparkle._

> A dam? Yes please!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:32 PM)_

> What's the point of a dam in this situation?

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:32 PM)_

> Means civilization, dummy.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:32 PM)_

t!choose Dam | City | Forest | Nothing

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:32 PM)_

> Means there might be people nearby.

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:32 PM)_

🤔 | MultiTheDuck, I pick Dam!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:32 PM)_

> Dams are cool.

_Iris plays with Emmett's ears._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:32 PM)_

> ۳ȝԗ'$ ƔȝϾ$ $ݛ ȽݛÞ $ɷɍ@ɍ ӴǼҐ@ ÞïϾԗŚ!

_Zielic Translation: Can't wait to rob these guys blind!_

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:32 PM)_

> Meaning we can get essentials...

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:33 PM)_

_Danny scoffs as the group heads down the stream._

> They a'ight.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:33 PM)_

_Emmett taps his goggles and sees the dam in the distance, along with heat signatures inside._

> Yep. Looks like we found a dam.
> I think it's just wooden.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:33 PM)_

> Okay, so we are definitely on the right track now

_Hector flies his drone back to himself and puts it back in his bag._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:33 PM)_

> Doesn't look sturdy.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:33 PM)_

> Don't judge.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:33 PM)_

> My dad built a dam once... On his planet, not mine.

_Iris sighs._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:33 PM)_

> That means more fun, Seth!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:33 PM)_

t!8ball Does Chomsky run ahead to the other side of the dam

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:33 PM)_

🎱 | My sources say no, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:34 PM)_

_As they get closer to the dam, Emmett stops and looks up at his partner._

> Iris, what should we do?

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:34 PM)_

> So, who wants to scout around the dam?
> In case of any ambushers and such.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris know everything there is to know about dams?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:34 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, Jelsafan0.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:34 PM)_

_Deyner catches a sight of a mouse inside of the ship's main kitchen's fridge._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:35 PM)_

_Seth stops with Emmett and holds out his arms._

> Dam, son.

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:35 PM)_

t!8ball Does seeing the mouse attempt to heat up the spaghetti fill Deyner with determination and cause him to fix up the ship at a faster pace?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:35 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, Deyner.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:35 PM)_

> It's like an evolved form of a typical beaver dam.
> I recognize the general structure.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:36 PM)_

_Danny scoffs._

> No more dam puns, please.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:36 PM)_

_Iris puts her hand to her chin._

> But... then again...

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:36 PM)_

_Hector snaps at Danny playfully._

> I'll do whatever I dam choose to!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:36 PM)_

_Emmett eyeballs the stream heading into the dam._

> Think there might be fish people here?

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:36 PM)_

_Hector's stomach gurgles._

> I hope so.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:36 PM)_

> I hope not.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:36 PM)_

t!8ball Does Danny watch the stream alone in blissful serenity?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:36 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, Platinum_Pathos.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:37 PM)_

> No, the fish people would be in the water.
> Not in the dam, you dorks.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:37 PM)_

_Seth frowns._

> I don't want to fuck a fish.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:37 PM)_

> Get me closer to the dam, Emmett!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:37 PM)_

> Uh, alright.

_Emmett walks over to the dam and crouches close enough for Iris to study the wood._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:37 PM)_

_Iris rubs her fingers on the dam, noticing teeth marks and indentations within the structure._

> The teeth marks on the wood are reminiscent of a platypus--the way the sealant is packed in is consistent with their tail strength.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:37 PM)_

> Why don't we head into the dam then?

**Deyner** _(07-Oct-18 03:37 PM)_

_Tuckered out from fixing things around the ship, Deyner decides to take a nap._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:37 PM)_

> Then just go a day without sex, it's not that hard!

_Hector mumbles._

> I haven't had sex in like half a GUY...

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:37 PM)_

_Emmett looks at Garrick blankly._

> I don't think I can breathe water.
> Don't know about you guys.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:37 PM)_

> Well all of us need to breathe, so...

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:38 PM)_

> Alright, then I'll go.

_Garrick floats down and inspects the dam beneath the water._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:38 PM)_

> No thanks.

_Seth eyeballs Emmett and Iris._

> I hope something that isn't furry lives here.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:38 PM)_

> What if some kind of... beaver-platypus hybrid lives here?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:39 PM)_

> Could be cool...
> Whoa, whoa!

_Emmett pretends to trip into the river, tightening his grasp to make sure Iris doesn't actually fall in._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:39 PM)_

_Chomsky chuckles as he watches Emmett, thinking of a cartoon he learned about in history class ages ago._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:39 PM)_

_Seth closes his eyes and smiles, fantasizing._

> I hope we find a nice little female dragon that I can fuck.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:39 PM)_

> Ah!

_Iris cautiously laughs._

> I wouldn't do that if I were you! Beavers and platypi are known to be very territorial and build their homes either immediately next to or within their dams!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:40 PM)_

> Dam, I don't see anything down here.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:40 PM)_

> You guys go on ahead.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:40 PM)_

_Garrick goes through the dam, to the other side and hears extremely muffled yelling._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:41 PM)_

> `Old Ottori Woman`: GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!
> _`Old Ottori Woman`: The ottori chitters angrily._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:41 PM)_

_Garrick backs off from the Ottori person and yells in surprise._

> Ɣɷȝ$ $ɷɍ ɷɍïï?!

_Zielic Translation: What the hell?!_
_He very quickly goes back out._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:41 PM)_

_Seth catches a whiff of Garrick's interaction over the comms._

> Oh!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:41 PM)_

_Emmett puts Iris down and awkwardly rests his elbow on her shoulder; it's a little uncomfortable as Iris is taller than him._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:42 PM)_

_Garrick ascends to where the others are and points behind himself._

> Guys, there are people there.
> They're very furry.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:42 PM)_

_Seth groans and unbuttons his pants._

> Guess it'll have to do.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:42 PM)_

_Emmett scoffs at Seth's behavior._

> Iris, want to just chill up here?

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:43 PM)_

_Seth beats his chest and screams into the riverbed._

> HEY! GIVE ME YOUR BEST WOMAN FOR ME TO FUCK PLEASE!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:43 PM)_

_`Old Ottori Woman`: An ottori emerges from the dam, shaking her fist at Garrick. She has a Brooklyn accent._

> `Old Ottori Woman`: Ey'! Get outta my house! What'a you doin' here?! I ain't take kindly to no teresspassas!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:43 PM)_

_Danny gasps from how blatant Seth was being._

> Seth, don't be rude! We don't even know who these people are!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:43 PM)_

> I do not care!
> I need to have sex!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:43 PM)_

_Garrick flips off the Ottori woman._

> Piss off, you furry old hag! I'll do what I want!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:44 PM)_

> `Old Ottori`: WHY YOU LITTLE-!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:44 PM)_

_`Old Ottori Man`: An Ottori man emerges, grabbing her arm._

> `Old Ottori Man`: Hey, Hey, Martha, settle it down there.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:44 PM)_

_Garrick groans._

> Yeah, I don't think we're gonna get much from them.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:45 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth throw a rock at the dam causing it to crumble and kill everyone in it?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:45 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:45 PM)_

_`Ottori Ringbearer`: An Ottori walks up to the absurdly tall elf man._

> `Ottori Ringbearer`: Are you Ubley Cos?

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:45 PM)_

> `Old Ottori Man`: I'm sorry about my wife there. She's very territorial after we were attacked last year.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:45 PM)_

> Yes.

_Seth puts his fists to his hips and poses._

> That is I.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:46 PM)_

> Iris, you okay?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:46 PM)_

_`Ottori Ringbearer`: The ottori bows immediately._

> AH! Ubley! I apologize!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:46 PM)_

_Iris remains focused on the Ottori civilians coming out of the dam._

> I'm fine. I told you, though. They are territorial.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:46 PM)_

> Ah, not a problem my friend!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:46 PM)_

> `Ottori Ringbearer`: Have my rings!

_`Ottori Ringbearer`: The ringbearer tosses various rings at Seth._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:47 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick go invade another house?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:47 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, definitely, RPretribution.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:47 PM)_

_Danny grits his teeth and turns around, yelling at the others._

> Hey, quiet down you imbeciles! I'm trying to watch this stream in blissful serenity!

_As Danny turns back around, he mutters to himself._

> You people are always too dam loud...

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:47 PM)_

_Seth catches the rings and ogles them within his hands._

> Thank you, I shall take these and cherish these forever.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:47 PM)_

_`Ottori Girl`: As Garrick enters her shower, an Ottori girl screeches at him and desperately covers herself up._

> `Ottori Girl`: HEY! GET OUT OF HERE!!!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:47 PM)_

> `Ottori Ringbearer`: They're all cock rings of various sizes!
> `Ottori Ringbearer`: As you requested, Ubley Cos!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:47 PM)_

_Seth stares at the rings in disgust._

> Oh god why?!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:47 PM)_

> `Ottori Ringbearer`: Only a couple have been used! But they've been washed, do not worry!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:48 PM)_

> I don't really care about the fish people. I care about you, Iris.

_Emmett frowns and holds Iris's hand._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:49 PM)_

_Unfazed by the girl's panic, Garrick goes to another room._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:49 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick pull out a boomerang out of his pocket?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:49 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, definitely, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:49 PM)_

_`Ottori Girl`: The girl puts on a towel and races after Garrick, pissed that he was intruding in her household._

> `Ottori Girl`: HEY! GET BACK HERE!

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:49 PM)_

_Hector whispers into his watch, unsure of what to do next._

> So what's the plan, guys?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:50 PM)_

> You've been worrying me a little.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:50 PM)_

_Iris looks at Emmett in surprise, clasping her hand around his._

> Hm? How so?

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:50 PM)_

> The plan is to watch streams in blissful serenity!

_Danny groans._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:50 PM)_

_Seth yells out to Emmett with the rings still in his hands._

> Emmett, I got you gifts!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:50 PM)_

_`Ottori Girl`: the Ottori girl swings at Garrick with a broom she grabbed._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:50 PM)_

> They are rings!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:51 PM)_

> Ever since we've had those...

_Emmett looks around suspiciously and clears his throat emphatically._

> ... chats, we've been opening up to one another.
> When you don't seem so well, I get concerned.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:51 PM)_

_There is a lot of loud crashing noises in the Ottori home. Garrick comes out with a bunch of gold figures and a stuffed frog._

> Hey! I got some stuff!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:52 PM)_

_Seth notices Emmett and Iris deep in conversation and slips the cock rings in Emmett's hoof before leaving them._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:52 PM)_

_Danny becomes entranced by the stream, ignoring the others entirely._

> Guys, this is the calmest stream I've ever seen...

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:52 PM)_

_Chomsky holds his arms out in disbelief._

> Garrick, stop stealing!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:52 PM)_

> Stealing is my middle name!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:52 PM)_

_`Ottori Girl`: The Ottori girl follows him fuming, her fur still damp from the shower._

> `Ottori Girl`: HEY! THAT WAS MY NANA'S! GIVE IT BACK!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:52 PM)_

_Chomsky groans loudly._

> Why can't we ever make friends with the locals for once!?

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:52 PM)_

> I'm fine...
> I'm just running hot, thats all.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:53 PM)_

t!8ball Does the sight of Garrick stealing from them anger the locals into attacking?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:53 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, MultiTheDuck.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:53 PM)_

> And also, am I being too clingy? I don't want you to be uncomfortable...

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:53 PM)_

> Does someone have a camera? I must document this brilliant stream...

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:54 PM)_

_Iris shakes her head._

> Nah. I like this. If I was uncomfortable, I would tell you.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:54 PM)_

t!8ball Does Chomsky approach one of the Ottori and explain that they are not there to make enemies

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:54 PM)_

🎱 | Don't count on it, PlasmaPerson.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:54 PM)_

_Garrick shakes the heirlooms uncaringly._

> Think we could sell these?

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:55 PM)_

_`Ottori Girl`: The Ottori girl jumps at Garrick, trying her best to swipe her mother's heirlooms from him._

> `Ottori Girl`: HEY! LEAVE MY NANA'S HEIRLOOMS ALONE!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:55 PM)_

_Garrick floats just out of the girl's reach._

> NO!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:55 PM)_

_Chomsky pinches his forehead, annoyed._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:55 PM)_

_Emmett looks to the ground, a tad flustered._

> It just feels different now.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 03:55 PM)_

> Garrick, put the stuff back!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 03:55 PM)_

> Absolutely not!
> Ever hear of "Finders Keepers"?!

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:55 PM)_

> Garrick if you're going to rob people you could at least try and be subtle about it!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:56 PM)_

_Iris's face turns red._

> Emmett...

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:56 PM)_

> `Ottori Girl`: WHY I OUGHTA-!

_`Ottori Girl`: The girl whimpers._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:56 PM)_

> You and I...

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:56 PM)_

_Iris begins to overheat from her shame._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 03:57 PM)_

_Hector draws out his rifle and loads knockout syringes into it._

> Do I just need to knock her out?

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:58 PM)_

t!8ball Does the twelve-year-old ottori girl have a kid crush on Garrick?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:58 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 03:58 PM)_

> Your hand's getting warmer.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:59 PM)_

_Iris nods sluggishly, feeling quite uncomfortable. However, she appears to not have the strength to tell Emmett, ironically._

> Yeah.... fire.... n' stuff....

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 03:59 PM)_

t!8ball Does Danny pour water from the stream on Iris and Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:59 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, Platinum_Pathos.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 03:59 PM)_

_Iris jumps from the water being splashed onto her._

> EEP!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 03:59 PM)_

t!8ball Is the water from the stream Piss?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 03:59 PM)_

🎱 | Better not tell you now, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:00 PM)_

_Emmett is startled from the water and he groans, blinking profusely._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:00 PM)_

_Iris furrows her brow and yells in Danny's direction._

> WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT!?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:00 PM)_

_Emmett is irked, the moment between him and Iris now ruined._

> I guess we're wet now.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:00 PM)_

> I need you to test the stream water!

_Danny sloshes his hands in the water._

> I will get more!

_Danny splashes at Iris and Emmett once more._

> Do not worry, I shall satisfy your need to be wet together!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:01 PM)_

_`Ottori Girl`: The Ottori girl turns pink and stiffens._

> `Ottori Girl`: Look. If you want my nana's heirlooms, you'll have to take me too!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:01 PM)_

_Garrick is grossed out by the Ottori girl's suggestion._

> Sorry kid, I only keep adults as slaves.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:01 PM)_

_Emmett gets up and lets go of Iris's hand._

> Let's get out of here.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:01 PM)_

_Chomsky is baffled by Garrick's response._

> Thaaaat's creepy!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:02 PM)_

> `Ottori Girl`: H-hey!

_`Ottori Girl`: The Ottori girl exclaims, red faced._

> `Ottori Girl`: I-I'm an adult!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:02 PM)_

_Garrick cringes._

> You look nine. Get outta here!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:02 PM)_

_Danny, trying to be annoying, stands up from the stream._

> I shall follow you Emmett, the stream no longer intrigues me!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:02 PM)_

_`Ottori Girl`: The Ottori girl's face turns very red and she starts to tear up._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:02 PM)_

_Emmett sighs._

> Danny, I think there's abundant food in the dam.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:03 PM)_

> What is going on in there Garrick!?

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:03 PM)_

_Danny stares at the dam and ponders._

> Surely it must if it is this large.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:03 PM)_

_Emmett winks and nudges Danny._

> Specifically fish people, if you catch my drift.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:03 PM)_

_Seth stomps his foot._

> Garrick just fuck her and get it over with!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:03 PM)_

> It seems that Garlic is playing hard to get.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:03 PM)_

> I shall go and ask to borrow some of their supply.

_Danny marches away from Emmett and Iris towards the dam._

> I shall be of use!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:03 PM)_

> Or else I'll dress up as you and do the job for you!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:03 PM)_

> You go do that...

_Emmett reverts his attention to Iris._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:03 PM)_

_`Ottori Girl`: The girl screeches, loud and extremely high in pitch._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:04 PM)_

_Seth clasps his ears, trembling._

> Ow, my ears!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:04 PM)_

_`Ottori Girl`: All otters stand at attention, recognizing the shriek of despair._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:04 PM)_

_Hector holds his ears with all six hands._

> Oh god!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:04 PM)_

_Emmett pulls back his head, trying to block out the obnoxiously loud shriek._

> Iris!
> Are you sure you're okay?!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:04 PM)_

_Danny grimaces, embarrassed to be involved in this situation._

> I'm no longer comfortable near this dam.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:04 PM)_

> What the heck was that for?!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:05 PM)_

> `Old Ottori Man`: Jesus, Jessica!

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:06 PM)_

_Hector draws out his rifle and aims it at Jessica._

> Screech like that again and you'll regret it!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:06 PM)_

_Iris leans her head into Emmett's so that he could hear her. She breathes deeply and whispers._

> I'm.... fine....

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:06 PM)_

> Alright, that's it!

_Seth strips off his clothes and rips his jeans into a makeshift small vest. He also rips his navy boxers into a long strip that he ties around his eyes, poking out eyeholes._

> I'M NOW GARRICK! AHHHHH!

_Seth runs around and does a scream additive to the Ottori girl's._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:06 PM)_

> Okay, you need to settle down.

_Garrick reaches into his pockets and pulls out a taser._

t!8ball Does Garrick tase the little girl?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:06 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, RPretribution.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:06 PM)_

_`Jessica`: After being tased, the Ottori girl screams even louder, popping everyone's ear drums._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:06 PM)_

> That works, Garrick!

_Hector immediately grabs his ears again._

> FUCK!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:07 PM)_

_Chomsky watches Garrick and Seth and is revolted by both of their actions; both by Garrick tasing a child and Seth running around naked in front of one._

> WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?

_He covers his ears just like before._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:07 PM)_

_`Ottori Ringbearer`: The ringbearer holds an ear to the ground and covers the other with his paws, tearing up from how disgustingly loud Jessica was being._

> `Ottori Ringbearer`: Make it stop!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:07 PM)_

t!8ball Does one of the Ottori start running around with a bomb in his hands, screaming in panic?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:07 PM)_

🎱 | Ask again later, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:07 PM)_

_Seth dashes around, holding his arms out stupidly and pretending to steal rocks and sticks off the ground._

> I'M AUTISTIC!

_He makes his way to Jessica and poses._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:07 PM)_

> You're just now asking that question, Chomsky?

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:07 PM)_

_`Jessica`: Jessica blubbers out, having stopped screaming momentarily._

> `Jessica`: H-HE HATES MEEEEEEEE!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:07 PM)_

> YOU JUST TAZED A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL, GARRICK!
> OF COURSE I'M JUST NOW ASKING THIS!

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:07 PM)_

_Hector shoots the little girl with a knockout dart, tired of her antics._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:07 PM)_

_Seth holds his arms out to Jessica and crouches._

> I LOVE YOU!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:08 PM)_

> `Jessica` I'M 12!!

_`Jessica`: Jessica screams louder, clearly upset._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:08 PM)_

> WE GOT OPTIONS, BABY!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:08 PM)_

> Okay, you guys are being much more violent then usual towards random people.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:08 PM)_

_Emmett drags the clearly not okay Iris to a nearby pond. The stream setting isn't cutting out given how chaotic it's becoming._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:08 PM)_

_Danny grimaces._

> I don't like your ideologies of options Seth...

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:09 PM)_

_`Jessica`: Jessica begins to kick and scream and the ground._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:09 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth spartan kick Chomsky out a window?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:09 PM)_

_`Jessica`: Jessica's parents emerge._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:09 PM)_

_Garrick raises an eyebrow, utterly confused by the child's display of resilience._

> How are you still conscious??

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:09 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick taze the parents also?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:09 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:09 PM)_

_Emmett quickly lets go of Iris as she continues to burn._

> You're burning hot!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:09 PM)_

_Garrick tases Jessica's parents with a much higher voltage than before._

> ŚϾɍ, ҐݛǼ мǼȽȽҐ мȽɍȝƟ@!

_Zielic Translation: DIE, YOU FURRY FREAKS!_

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:09 PM)_

_`Jessica`: Jessica continues to have a temper tantrum, though she begins to slow down, the knockout dart slowly taking its effect._

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:09 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 6, Jelsafan0.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:10 PM)_

> Uh... Yeah. Catch you all later.

_Chomsky slowly backs away from the others._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:10 PM)_

_Emmett shakes his hoof in front of Iris's face, it being deeply lost in thought._

> Iris, can you hear me?

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:10 PM)_

_Iris squints her eyes and scowls._

> ..Mmhmm...

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:10 PM)_

> Yeah, I don't think so.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:10 PM)_

_Danny speaks into his watch._

> Iris if you die can I eat the items in your room?

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:11 PM)_

> ҐݛǼ'Ƚɍ ۳ȽȝЭҐ!

_Zielic Translation: You're crazy!_

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:11 PM)_

_`Old Ottori Woman`: With Jessica's parents incapacitated, another ottori assumes the role of her guardian._

> `Old Ottori Woman`: Jessica, sweetheart, what's wrong?

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:11 PM)_

> Okay, I'm going to try and find the food now.

_Danny pushes past the others and heads into the dam, puffing up his cheeks with air._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:11 PM)_

> Ґɍȝɷ, ҐݛǼ @ɷݛǼïŚ'ϰɍ ƟԗݛƔԗ.

_Zielic Translation: Yeah, you should've known._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:11 PM)_

_Seth does a little jig, flashing his hands out at the tased parents._

> GARRICK, GO MEET YOUR IN-LAWS!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:12 PM)_

> Seeing as we're wet, and you're burning up...

_Emmett pushes Iris into the pond, and dips in it himself. It's deep enough to get just up to Emmett's shoulders._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:12 PM)_

_Garrick watches as Danny heads into the dam and dramatically sighs._

> ARE WE GONNA ROB THEM OR NOT????

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:12 PM)_

> `Jessica`: H-HE DOESN'T LIKE MEEEEE!!!!

_`Jessica`: In her tirade, Jessica mistakenly points at Seth._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:12 PM)_

> She points at the wrong Garrick

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:14 PM)_

_Iris stares at Emmett tiredly, having scrapped her leg after being pushed into the pond._

> ... Ow.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:14 PM)_

`Jessica`: t!8ball does Jessica start glowing?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:15 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:15 PM)_

> I'm sorry. You're burning hot.
> Had to do something.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:15 PM)_

> Oh, guess I should do something about him...

_Seth jumps up and slaps the taser out of Garrick's hands._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:15 PM)_

t!8ball Does Danny find the Ottoris' food storage supply?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:15 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, Platinum_Pathos.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:15 PM)_

_Chomsky runs off from Seth and Garrick to find anyone else in the crew with sanity still remaining._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:15 PM)_

_Seth puts a hand to his chest and jutts the other one forward romantically._

> Don't worry my future in-laws I am planning on marrying your daughter! My twin just was being a retard.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:16 PM)_

> Its... okay.... I'm just... tired...

_Iris remains in the pond, but she leans over and folds her arms onto the bank and rests her face in them._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:16 PM)_

> Seth, what the hell!? She's a child!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:16 PM)_

_Seth turns his torso around and gives Hector a crazed, manic look. He sticks a finger to his mouth._

> I AM GARRICK, SHHHH!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick take the costume off of Seth?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris feel better after having a nice dip in the pond?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:17 PM)_

🎱 | Better not tell you now, Zander.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:17 PM)_

> SETH! STOP!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:17 PM)_

_Seth points at Garrick with a wide grin._

> YOU STOP!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:17 PM)_

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:17 PM)_

_Garrick gasps from the sudden appearance of the Llamanians._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:18 PM)_

_`Jessica's Father`: Jessica's parents are able to stand and speak after having been tased so drastically._

> YES!

_Seth makes a heart with his hands over his chest._

> I LOVE HER SO MUCH!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:18 PM)_

> `Jessica's Mother`: Jessica sweetheart, the nice man says he loves you!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:18 PM)_

_Seth hears the Llamanians overhead and jumps back in fear._

> OH FUCK!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:18 PM)_

_Garrick ignores the ship landing and holds out his hand, clenching it._

> Ignore my dipshit twin over there. Give me all your money.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:19 PM)_

_Iris opens her eyes from her slight nap and smirks at Emmett drowsily._

> Hiiii, Emmett....

_She taps his snout._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:19 PM)_

_`Llamanian Ship`: Llamanians start to exit the ship, fully armed._

> `Jessica`: Yay!!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:19 PM)_

_Iris giggles softly._

> Lookie what I can do...

_She tosses a small ball of flame between her hands, juggling it._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:20 PM)_

_Emmett chuckles confusedly._

> That's pretty cool...

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:20 PM)_

_Chomsky meets Emmett and Iris at the pond._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:20 PM)_

_Seth pulls out his pistol and starts shooting at the Llamanians._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:21 PM)_

_Iris wakes up more, realizing both she and Emmett were inside of a pond._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:21 PM)_

_Chomsky stops at the pond and points to the Llamanian ship that's landed._

> Hey lovebirds, there's kind of an impending war going on.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:21 PM)_

_Iris stops juggling the fireball for a moment and stares into the pond she's in._

> ... What... what am I doing, again?

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:21 PM)_

> EMMETT, LLAMAS ARE HERE!

_Seth continues to shoot at the Llamanians like crazy._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:21 PM)_

> ӴϾϰɍ Њɍ ȝïï ݛм ҐݛǼȽ ЊݛԗɍҐ ҐݛǼ ϾŚϾݛ$@!

_Zielic Translation: Give me all of your money you idiots!_

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:21 PM)_

_`Llamanian Ship`: The Llamanians make a loud noise outside the dam. As soon as Seth starts to shoot, they do too._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:21 PM)_

> I need her to calm down, Chomsky.

_Emmett mutes his coms._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:22 PM)_

_Chomsky cringes at Emmett's lax reaction. Maybe no one in this crew is sane anymore._

> Calming down isn't easy with a battle going on but... okay.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:22 PM)_

> DON'T WORRY YOUR PRETTY LITTLE HEAD JESSICA! WE'RE GETTING YOU TO A SAFE PLACE SO WE CAN GET MARRIED!

_Seth manages to down a Llamanian soldier, but he has to reload!_

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:22 PM)_

_Iris continues to toss the fireball for a bit._

> Hmm... wanna see more fire tricks?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:22 PM)_

_Emmett shivers, the wind causing the pond to feel much cooler._

> Yeah.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:22 PM)_

_Iris snuggles into Emmett's arms unconsciously, keeping him warm. She conjures shapes out of fire, shapes of elves and squoatlings and hearts and stars._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:22 PM)_

_Seth momentarily lets go of Jess and reloads his Desert Eagle. He yells to try and get the others' attention._

> Hey guys, llamas are here!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:22 PM)_

_Danny finds several sacks and coolers before he packs up over half of the Ottori food supply including, but not limited to: frozen fish, shrimp, canned berries, frogs, squirrels, beans, corn, and oddly enough potato chips and popcorn._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:23 PM)_

_Hector walks up to a teller inside the dam and grabs them, injecting them with a high concentration knockout dart knocking them out quickly._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:23 PM)_

_Garrick finally re-enters the dam, just wanting to satisfy his kleptomaniac urges._

> Well, you guys have fun with the llamas. I'm gonna keep breaking and entering.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:23 PM)_

t!choose Chomsky goes back to garrick | Chomsky fights the lammas

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:23 PM)_

🤔 | PlasmaPerson, I pick Chomsky goes back to Garrick!

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:23 PM)_

_Hector speaks with his mask covering his face._

> Thank god this place is empty...

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:23 PM)_

> Iris...

_Emmett is startled for a moment, but then he relaxes into the snuggling._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:23 PM)_

_Garrick collects various items while in the dam from unsuspecting Ottori._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:23 PM)_

_`Llamanian Ship`: The llamas shoot towards Chomsky as he heads back to the dam._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:23 PM)_

_Assuming that Garrick was back in the dam, Chomsky dodges the flurry of Llamanian bullets, holds his breath, and dives into the dam. Surprisingly, only the entrance was underwater, and most of it was breathable._

> Hey, Garrick, there's a war going on out there!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:24 PM)_

_Garrick scoffs and grins._

> What am I supposed to do about that?

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:24 PM)_

_A shot goes right in front of Chomsky; it just so happens that the Llamanians are hightailing him!_

> Woah!

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:24 PM)_

_Hector backs away from the glass and loads an explosive dart._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:24 PM)_

> Isn't that cool?

_Iris chuckles softly._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:24 PM)_

> That's really pretty.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:24 PM)_

> Garrick get down here!
> Need your help robbing this shit!

_Hector fires the dart at the window then detonates it._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:24 PM)_

> I don't know Garrick, maybe help us out instead of being a douche and taking peoples' stuff?!

_Chomsky dodges out of the way of another shot._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:25 PM)_

_After a while of cuddling with her boyfriend, Iris fully wakes up all the way._

> What... happened?

_She extinguishes the fire in her hands._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:25 PM)_

> You started to show me some fire tricks?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:25 PM)_

`Llamanian Ship`: t!roll d25

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:26 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d25... Rolled a 22, Zander.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:25 PM)_

_`Llamanian Ship`: Twenty-two llamanian soldiers have gotten out of the ship, each tailing either Seth, Chomsky, or Jess's innocent family._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:26 PM)_

> Oh, well...

_Iris looks into Emmett's mustardy gaze and tilts her head._

> That's... strange.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:27 PM)_

_Hector climbs over the teller's desk and starts grabbing all the currency he sees._

> Garrick! Get over here!

_Hector then drags the teller to the vault door and uses their hand to open it._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:27 PM)_

_Chomsky runs away from the Llamanian soldiers._

> AAAAH!
> Garrick, please help! I'm being shot at!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:27 PM)_

> SHOOT BACK THEN, CHOMSKY!

_Seth lands a perfect shot in a soldier's temple, splitting his head in twain._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

> `Llamanian Soldier 1`: STOP! IN THE NAME OF THE LLAMANIAN EMPIRE!

_`Llamanian Soldier 1`: The soldier takes a shot at Chomsky's shoulder, penetrating his target._

> `Llamanian Soldier 1`: Bullseye!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

_`Llamanian Ship`: A weak bomb is thrown into the dam._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

> I'm too far away to attack them and live!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris stand up from the pond and dry her clothes with her powers?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

🎱 | My sources say no, Jelsafan0.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

> I'm die-!

_Chomsky hides around a corner and winsces, holding his arm in agony._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

_Garrick grabs Chomsky's arm and takes him inside the bank interior._

> Then come on! In here!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

> GET CLOSER TO THEM THEN! I GOTTA PROTECT THIS NEW WIFE!

_Seth drags Jessica around a boulder and dashes in the direction of the pond._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

_Emmett looks at his arms holding Iris tightly._

> Do you want me to let go of you?

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

t!8ball Does Danny walk out of the dam with all of the food without a struggle?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, definitely, Platinum_Pathos.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth pass by Emmett and Iris?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, definitely, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

> LLAMAS ARE HERE, EMMETT!
> GET OUT OF THE POOL AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

_Chomsky pants and feels his shoulder ooze out._

> Please tell me you have something to patch this up!

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

_Hector starts filling his bag with as much currency and valuables he can from the bank vault._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:28 PM)_

> I might.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:29 PM)_

_Emmett just blinks from this statement, not fully aware of what is going on._

> What?!

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:29 PM)_

_After filling a couple of bags, Hector leaves the vault and pulls his wrist to his mouth._

> Wait, Seth, who's here attacking us?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:29 PM)_

> LLAMAS ARE HERE, ATTACKING THE DAM!
> GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:29 PM)_

> Oh, no...

_Iris mumbles, brows furrowed. Despite this news, Iris stays put within Emmett's hug._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:29 PM)_

> I'll be right up, just snagging some cash!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:29 PM)_

_Chomsky inspects the wound in his shoulder, revealing an alarming amount of blood._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:29 PM)_

> Hey Emmett, I'm heading back to the ship, with the food. Should I come back just in case?

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:29 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick pull out some bandages from his pockets?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:29 PM)_

🎱 | Better not tell you now, RPretribution.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:30 PM)_

> I gotta protect this girl, so I'm bringing her back to the ship guys!

_Seth starts to book it towards the camp._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:30 PM)_

> Guess I won't then if we're all headed back.

_Danny begins his fifteen minute trek back to the ship, satisfied with his food haul._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:31 PM)_

t!8ball Do the llamanians shoot at the crew's camp?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:31 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, Zander.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:31 PM)_

> `Llamanian Soldier 2`: REBEL SHIP! TAKE IT DOWN!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:31 PM)_

_Seth jumps angrily, watching the ship get shot at in the distance._

> REEEEEEEE! THEY ARE DESTROYING OUR CAMP

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:31 PM)_

_Iris pulls herself from Emmett's grasp._

> I'm exhausted and we should really get going...

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:32 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth lube up his laser pistol and shoot it at the attackers?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:32 PM)_

🎱 | My sources say no, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:32 PM)_

_Emmett let go of Iris, a bit embarrassed of their time spent cuddling while the Llamanians attacked._

> Yeah.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:32 PM)_

_Iris stands up, drying herself off with her fire powers._

> Let's go, shall we? We'll always have more time to spend together when we're safe.

_Iris smiles, offering Emmett her hand._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:33 PM)_

_Emmett takes Iris's hand, getting out of the pond._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:33 PM)_

_Hector stores his rifle on his back and then starts running as fast as he can on all eight of his limbs while hoisting the bank money._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:33 PM)_

`Llamanian Ship`: t!choose 1 | 2 | 90 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1| 3 | 1 | 1

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:33 PM)_

🤔 | Bagelwrecker, I pick 1!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:33 PM)_

> `Llamanian Soldier 2:` HOLD IT!

_`Llamanian Solder 2`: The soldier takes a shot at the escapees running towards the camp._

`Llamanian Solder 2`: t!choose Seth | Garrick | Emmett | Seth | Hector | Danny | No one

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:33 PM)_

🤔 | Zander, I pick Seth!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:33 PM)_

_Iris drags Emmett quickly through the woods to camp._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:34 PM)_

_Seth notices the soldier shooting at him too late and cries out in terror._

> OOOGA!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:35 PM)_

`Llamanian Solder 2`: t!roll d25

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:35 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d25... Rolled a 1, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:35 PM)_

_As the blast barely hits his toe, Seth screams dramatically and plants his foot into the ground._

> OW, MY TOENAIL!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:35 PM)_

t!choose more idols | food | money | knives | laser guns

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:35 PM)_

🤔 | RPretribution, I pick knives!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:35 PM)_

_Garrick quickly floats back to the camp with a bunch of stolen knives._

> C'mon, Chomsky!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:36 PM)_

_Emmett stops upon seeing the massive Llamanian warship._

> Shit! He wasn't lying!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:36 PM)_

_Chomsky rubs his aching, splintered face, stopping in a hallway to keep himself steady._

> It's a little hard to do that when you keep phasing through walls!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:36 PM)_

> I GOTTA PROTECT THIS GIRL!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:36 PM)_

_Iris's eyes widen as she notices the ship._

> Oh boy!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:37 PM)_

> Let's make haste!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:37 PM)_

> Agreed!

_Iris darts towards the camp while still dragging Emmett, who has some difficulty in keeping up the pace._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:37 PM)_

_Chomsky hisses and puts pressure on his stinging bullet wound. He speaks into his watch._

> Hector, I need your help!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:37 PM)_

> THIS IS MY NEW DAUGHTER-WIFE THING!

_Seth picks up the sleeping Jessica and holds her to the sky at the camp._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:37 PM)_

> Where are you?!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:37 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick fart out a fridge out of stress?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:37 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, Zander.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:37 PM)_

> ۳Ƚȝԃ, ЊҐ мȽϾŚӴɍ мɍïï ݛǼ$ ݛм ЊҐ ԃݛ۳Ɵɍ$@!

_Zielic Translation: Crap, my fridge fell out of my pockets!_

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:37 PM)_

> I'm in one of the upper levels!
> I'm not sure which one.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:38 PM)_

> Send me coords, I can work with those!

_Hector taps into his watch, waiting for a message from Chomsky._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:38 PM)_

_Chomsky relays Hector the coordinates as requested._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:39 PM)_

_Seth runs into the ship and puts Jessica down in his quarters._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:39 PM)_

_Hector taps the coordinates he was sent to be given a big yellow MMORPG arrow that points towards Chomsky's location. He follows the arrow, getting annoyed by how occasionally the arrow would lead him directly into a wall._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:39 PM)_

_Iris and Emmett make it to the ship in one piece._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:39 PM)_

_`Jessica`: Jessica turns in her sleep, none the wiser about where she is._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:39 PM)_

_Chomsky pulls his head away from his shoulder as Hector comes closer to him._

> Ugh.... my shoulder... I've been shot.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:39 PM)_

_Emmett watches out of window as a bright red flare is shot towards the sky from the dam's location._

> Is that a distress signal?!

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:39 PM)_

> That's a lot of blood. I could probably fix it though...

_Hector digs into his bag, looking for tools to patchwork Chomsky's bullet wound with._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:39 PM)_

> Fuck, what the hell are we going to do?!

_Seth paces around, trying to scheme up something on the fly._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:39 PM)_

_Danny drops the bag of food on the floor near the hatch and taps Emmett's shoulder._

> Hey Emmett, I tried to contact you, did you lose your comms watch?

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:40 PM)_

_Seth looks at his akimbo laster blasters._

> These pistols aren't gonna do shit...

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:40 PM)_

t!8ball Do the Llamanians shoot at the ship with artillery?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:40 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:40 PM)_

_The ship rumbles as it's pelted with plasma blasts of various sizes and intensities._

> FUC-KK

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:40 PM)_

> Close the hangar!

_Emmett jumps up and pulls the lever to close the entryway hatch._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:40 PM)_

> Doesn't sound good out there...

_Hector pulls out his medical supplies and starts fixing Chomsky's shoulder._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:41 PM)_

_Seth shakes in panic._

> EMMETT, START UP THE ENGINE!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:41 PM)_

_Emmett looks at Seth, mortified._

> I THOUGHT WE WERE OUT OF POWER?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:41 PM)_

_Seth frowns and grips the wall as the ship continues to shake._

> I LIED TO GET US OFF OF OUR ASSES TO ROB THESE PEOPLE!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:41 PM)_

> You didn't need to lie to get me to do that, Seth!

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:41 PM)_

_Hector finishes dressing Chomsky's shoulder and quickly packs up his medical bag._

> Okay Chomsky that should be enough, we need to go right now!

t!8ball Do Hector and Chomsky arrive at the ship unharmed?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:42 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, MultiTheDuck.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:42 PM)_

_Chomsky bangs on the hatch to the ship and yells into his watch._

> OPEN THE HATCH UP! WE'RE GETTING KILLED OUT HERE!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:42 PM)_

_Garrick begrudingly opens the ship hatch up and closes it after Hector and Chomsky enter._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:42 PM)_

> These people...
> They killed my people.

_Emmett holds Iris, shivering._

> And I am terrified.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:42 PM)_

_Iris hugs Emmett and pats him comfortingly._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:42 PM)_

> Fuck man, I wanted to keep this a surprise!

_Seth pulls a case from under his bed and pulls out an advanced plasma crossbow with the engraving "Opportunity V2" on its limbs._

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:42 PM)_

> Garrick, why did you leave us to die!?

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:42 PM)_

> I thought you were right behind me!
> You were the one who decided to get shot and all.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:42 PM)_

_Chomsky flips off Garrick._

> Man, screw you!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:43 PM)_

_Seth races into the entrance with the large metallic crossbow in his arms._

> EMMETT, I GOT A PRESENT FOR YA!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:43 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick possess Chomsky's toenail inconveniently?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:43 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, definitely, Zander.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:43 PM)_

t!8ball Is Emmett inconveniently Fortnite dancing?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:43 PM)_

🎱 | Signs point to yes, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:44 PM)_

_Emmett gets up and dances, unsure what he's doing._

> Stress dance.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:44 PM)_

_Garrick unpossesses Chomsky's toenail, realizing his mistake._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:44 PM)_

_Danny watches Emmett in confusion._

> Emmett, I feel as though there are more important matters to attend to.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:44 PM)_

> Is there anyone else outside the ship?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:44 PM)_

_Emmett finishes his Fortnite default dance and glares at Danny._

> Danny, I muted my comms, okay? Relax!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:44 PM)_

t!8ball Do Iris's coordinates magically appear in her pocket?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:44 PM)_

🎱 | My sources say no, Jelsafan0.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:45 PM)_

_Chomsky rolls his wounded shoulder._

> I may not be able to hoister my flamethrower for a while, thanks to those stupid llamas.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:45 PM)_

> Just saying. We're getting attacked and you're dancing.

_Danny digs through his bag of food._

t!8ball Does Danny keep all of the chips and popcorn for himself?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:45 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, Platinum_Pathos.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:45 PM)_

_`Llamanian Ship`: The Llamanian ship shoots at the Panty Slingshot._

`Llamanian Ship`: t!roll 7d100

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:45 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a 7d100... Rolled a 83, a 44, a 100, a 51, a 59, a 10, and a 70, making 417, Zander.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:45 PM)_

_`Llamanian Ship`: The shots scorch the side of the Slingshot, denting some of the lesser used rooms._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:45 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth start to charge up Opportunity V2?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:45 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, Bagelwrecker.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:46 PM)_

_After the shots from the enemy ship, Chomsky hits his head on the wall._

> Gom!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:46 PM)_

_Seth activates the crossbow, flipping a switch. It glows a vibrant lime green, its flight groove and risers slowly filling up with a similar glow._

> EMMETT I GOT YOU A NEW PRESENT!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:46 PM)_

_Emmett backs up in surprise and smiles brightly, holding out his hooves excitedly._

> AHHHH! SETH, YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARD!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:46 PM)_

> It was meant to be a birthday gift, but...

_Seth hands Emmett the crossbow, it nearly fully charged up._

> MEET OPPORTUNITY V2!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:46 PM)_

_Emmett rotates the crossbow around, admiring its grooves and features. The crossbow starts to pulsate with a familiar frequency to Opportunity._

> HOLY SHIT, I LOVE IT!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:46 PM)_

_Seth opens up the hatch, completely disregarding any concerns over safety._

> LET'S DO A LITTLE FIRE TEST MY SON!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:47 PM)_

> I would love to do that, but...

_Emmett stands up, and hands Opportunity V2 back to Seth as it continues to charge._

> I need to start the ship first, papi.

_He quickly makes his way to the cockpit._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:47 PM)_

_Garrick places all of his the stolen items on a table, sorting them by apparent value._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:48 PM)_

_Iris remains on the ground and itches her arm. She really wants to bake right now._

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:48 PM)_

> We're gonna be rich. These idols are actual gold!

_Garrick laughs maniacally._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:48 PM)_

_Iris sits up straight and quickly asks the others._

> Does anybody want muffins?

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:49 PM)_

> WHO CARES ABOUT BEING RICH GARRICK, WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:49 PM)_

_Chomsky sighs._

> As long as its not blueberry...

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:49 PM)_

> WE'LL BE RICH AFTER WE ESCAPE, YOU DINGUS!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:49 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett get the ship started?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:49 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:49 PM)_

_Iris gives Chomsky a deadpan expression._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:49 PM)_

> You have muffins, Iris?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:49 PM)_

> Let's get the hell out of here...

_Emmett sets the ship to ascend automatically and he leaves the cockpit to join back with Seth._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:49 PM)_

> I have some coordinates, actually!
> I've got no clue where they lead though.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:49 PM)_

_Chomsky shrugs_

> Not a fan of blueberries. Worth a shot.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:49 PM)_

> WE NEED TO RESCIR THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:50 PM)_

_Iris digs around in her pockets. When she doesn't find the coordinates, she curses under her breath, dashing to her room._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:50 PM)_

_Seth grabs the ceiling as the ship ascends, expertly dodging from shots from the Llamanians._

> OPERATION 214 MANUVER RESCIR!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:50 PM)_

_When she arrives in her room, Iris begins to search the floor frantically for her map._

> Come on, come on...

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:51 PM)_

_Emmett stumbles as the shooting Llamanians cause some turbulence._

> Seth, toss me the baby!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:51 PM)_

_Garrick counts the idols, more focused on his greed than the escape._

t!roll d40

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:51 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d40... Rolled a 24, RPRetribution.

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:51 PM)_

> ... Twenty two, twenty three, twenty four. Twenty four idols!

_Garrick shakes his jazz hands._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:51 PM)_

_Danny stuffs his face with some chips._

> So, why exactly do we have a little Ottori girl on our ship? I thought we distinguished that kidnapping was only for dire situations.

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:51 PM)_

_Seth tosses the now charged Opportunity V2 to Emmett._

> That dam was under attack.
> I wasn't gonna leave a child to have her life taken by a fucking llama.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:52 PM)_

> Fair enough.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:51 PM)_

_Iris finds the piece of paper beneath her bed. She picks it up and takes a look at the coordinates excitedly._

> Got it!

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:52 PM)_

> I didn't do it to Emmett and I wouldn't do it to any other child.

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:53 PM)_

_Iris dashes back to the cockpit._

> Here!

_She slaps the paper on the navigation console._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:53 PM)_

> Emmett, Opportunity V2 should be charged, go ahead and fire it!

_Seth clasps his ears preemptively._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:54 PM)_

> HERE WE GO!

_Emmett aims his crosshair directly at the Llamanian warship's core, tilting a bit closer to its thrusters to try and ding the engine._

t!roll 10d125

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:54 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a 10d125... Rolled a 57, a 102, a 82, a 117, a 50, a 89, a 93, a 45, a 51, and a 96, making 782, Zander.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:55 PM)_

_Opportunity V2 expels a helix-shaped beam that penetrates the warship entirely, decimating the engine and causing a massive explosion in the forest. The trees begin to burn, along with the dam._

> Holy fuck, this thing packs a wallop!

**RPretribution** _(07-Oct-18 04:55 PM)_

_Garrick takes out his Specto-phone and takes a picture of the idols, getting back an approximate value of his haul from Thiefnet's calculator._

> 36,045 Ducketts for the gold idols... Sheesh.

**PlasmaPerson** _(07-Oct-18 04:55 PM)_

> Great... We stole precious heirlooms...

_Chomsky stares at the idols gloomily for a second, then he takes one to his room and shuts the door._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:55 PM)_

_Emmett notices that Opportunity V2 is still slightly charged; apparently his blast from before wasn't the full deal! For good measure, he shoots at the Llamanians once more with the rest of the charge._

t!roll 10d25

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 04:55 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a 10d25... Rolled a 3, a 14, a 20, a 18, a 17, a 5, a 2, a 23, a 5, and a 3, making 110, Zander.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:55 PM)_

_The additional shot incinerates three Llamanian soldiers shooting at the crew's ship, leaving nothing but their rifles and irradiated dust._

> Damn!

_Emmett looks into the flight groove of his weapon in awe and deactivates Opportunity V2. This weapon is definitely not legal._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:56 PM)_

> `Llamanian Soldier 3: Get into the corvettes! They can't shoot us all out if we're in a swarm formation!`

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:56 PM)_

_`Llamanian Ship`: The Llamanian soldiers remaining run to their ship and start up a corvette swarm, flying directly towards the Panty Slingshot._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:56 PM)_

> I honestly have no idea where these coordinates lead, but anywhere is better than here!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:56 PM)_

_Upon realizing the Llamanians' strategy, Emmett shuts the ship's hatch and races to the cockpit._

> Oh, shit!

_Emmett slams himself into the pilot's seat and unmutes his comms, speaking into them fervently._

> We need to flee! They're gaining on our tail!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:57 PM)_

_Danny rolls his eyes and pops open another potato chip bag._

> I would assume so...

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 04:57 PM)_

> Then get on with it already!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 04:57 PM)_

_Emmett takes Iris's scrap of paper, sets the navigation coordinates, and presses the button to hyperspace._

> Hold onto your asses!

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 04:58 PM)_

_Before the ship makes its getaway, Iris latches onto Emmett, holding onto his arm for dear life._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 04:58 PM)_

_Seth gets launched to the back of the crew quarters._

> FUCK!

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 04:58 PM)_

> I refuse!

_Danny stands tall, surprisingly not budging despite the insane speed the ship was moving at._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 05:01 PM)_

_After a couple of seconds, Emmett stops the hyperspace engines, slowing down the ship back to a reasonable speed for a crew._

> Iris?

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 05:02 PM)_

> Yeah?

_Iris is still gripping onto Emmett's arm._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 05:02 PM)_

_Emmett speaks into the ship's intercom._

> I think we made it...

_Emmett shakes his arm in discomfort, looking back at Iris._

> You can let go now. That is, unless you don't want to.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 05:03 PM)_

> Thank King Asgorod...

_Hector leaves to his room and starts decorating it with the artifacts he collected._

**Jelsafan0** _(07-Oct-18 05:03 PM)_

> Oh! Right!

_Iris blushes softly, letting go of Emmett's arm._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 05:03 PM)_

t!8ball Did a scientist ottori also stow away on the ship in the chaos?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 05:03 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 05:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does the scientist take refuge in Chomsky and Garrick's room?

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 05:04 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, Zander.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 05:05 PM)_

> Amateurs.

_Danny starts to count the amount of various food items he grabbed._

t!roll d100

**Tatsumaki** _(07-Oct-18 05:05 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d100... Rolled a 47, Platinum_Pathos.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 05:05 PM)_

> Adequate. Probably would last me about... a week or two.

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 05:07 PM)_

_Hector sets his pack down in his room and sees the small laser handgun in his side pocket._

> Oh, I need to give that to him soon...

_He then packs the Ottori money in a small box and puts it on his shelf._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 05:08 PM)_

_Seth enters the cockpit and raises his arms._

> Praise the goddess of life for getting us out!

_Seth does a little hand movement across his chest as thanks._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 05:08 PM)_

_Emmett furrows his brow at Seth mentioning an Elven deity. When was he religious? Why would he blaspheme Squoat?_

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 05:08 PM)_

_Hector grimaces._

> If we ever go back, I guess we'll have some money...

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 05:08 PM)_

> Praise Squoat too, don't worry, Emmett, I recognize him as one of my gods too.

_Seth pats Emmett on the back._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 05:10 PM)_

> Yeah...

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 05:10 PM)_

_Hector leaves his room and walks to the kitchen with the laser handgun in his pocket._

> Emmett, can you meet me in the kitchen for a moment?

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 05:10 PM)_

_Emmett smiles softly, getting up from the cockpit._

> Okay, Hector.

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 05:10 PM)_

> I don't recognize any gods...

_Danny lies on the ground, his stomach finally satiated after three bags of chips._

**Bagelwrecker** _(07-Oct-18 05:10 PM)_

_Seth stretches and heads to his room._

> What a rough ride...

_He lies back in his bed and takes a nap._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 05:11 PM)_

_Emmett strides over to the kitchen, having a newfound confidence from escaping that deathtrap._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 05:13 PM)_

_Danny groans._

> Guess I'll be helpful.

_He gets up and heads to the kitchen as well, storing the sacks full of food in the pantry and fridge._

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 05:13 PM)_

> Ah there he is!

_Hector takes out the laser pistol and holds it by the barrel._

> I meant to give you this a while back but never did...

_He hands it over to Emmett._

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 05:15 PM)_

_Emmett fumbles with the pistol handle, his grip apparently buttery with sweat. He manages to shoot at the wall with it, narrowly missing Danny's arm._

**Platinum_Pathos** _(07-Oct-18 05:16 PM)_

_Danny glares at Emmett, offended._

> Damn it Emmett, I didn't survive llamas to get shot with a pistol!

**Zander** _(07-Oct-18 05:16 PM)_

> Shit, did that hit you?!

**WatchfulDrake** _(07-Oct-18 05:16 PM)_

_Hector rubs his neck awkwardly._

> We can get Deyner to make a better grip for you.
