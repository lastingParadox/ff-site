**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 03:35 PM)_

_As Lucian walked down the roads of the ancient city of Detroit, he heard the engine of a ship. He looked up and saw the ship of a space crew; he ran down an alley to hide and went to observe the ship and its crew._

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:36 PM)_

_Emmett lounges in the pilot's seat, enjoying a slice of deep dish pizza._

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 03:37 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Lucian see anyone from the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 03:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Arky.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:38 PM)_

t!choose Emmett | Bail | Seth | Matthias | Jim | Asier | Jacob

**Tatsumaki** _(27-Jun-18 03:38 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | Zander, I pick Jim!

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 03:38 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Bail wake up?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 03:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:38 PM)_

@Magic8ball Is Bail in the middle of the street?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 03:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 03:38 PM)_

> Oof! I am awake and energized!

_Bail hops up and stretches his limbs. He looks around himself._

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:39 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett get up from the pilot's seat?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 03:39 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, Zander.

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 03:39 PM)_

> Now. Where am I?

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:39 PM)_

> `Random Driver`: Get out the road asshole!

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 03:39 PM)_

> Ok.

_Bail walks off the street._

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:39 PM)_

_Emmett shows up in the lounge._

> Y'know, the cops are still chasing us...

_Emmett finishes the pizza and wipes his mouth with a napkin._

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:40 PM)_

> Don't worry, they will have to take a plane.

_Jim flexes in success._

> They were not prepared for this.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:40 PM)_

> What do you mean? We're in burgerland.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:41 PM)_

_Emmett sticks out his tongue._

> Burgers are disgusting.
> Globs of grease on a bun.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:42 PM)_

@Magic8ball Is Bail inside of a dream?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 03:42 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, TheBlade.

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 03:42 PM)_

> Where the hell am I?

_Bail scratches his brand._

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:42 PM)_

> On the ship?

_Emmett raises an eyebrow._

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:42 PM)_

> Guys is Bail sleeptalking?

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:43 PM)_

> Someone toss me a strawberry pastry.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 03:43 PM)_

> Fascinating, maybe they can help with my promise...

_Lucian edges near the ship._

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:44 PM)_

> Emmett, I kind of ate them...

_Jim pats his belly._

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:44 PM)_

> Crap.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:44 PM)_

> I will say they were good!

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:44 PM)_

_Emmett sighs._

> I'm stuck eating burgerfood.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 03:44 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Lucian walk up to them to say hi?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 03:44 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Arky.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:45 PM)_

_Emmett looks out the window._

> There's some man-thing in the road near Bail.

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 03:45 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Bail escape his dream?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 03:45 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:45 PM)_

> Kill it!

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:45 PM)_

> Uhm, no.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:46 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth draw his weapon and take aim?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 03:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:46 PM)_

> What are you doing?

_Jim pokes Seth._

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:46 PM)_

> I'm going to eat your space weed if you do this, Seth.
> I know where it is.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:47 PM)_

_Seth scoffs._

> It's intergalactic grass, Emmett.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:47 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth take fire?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 03:47 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Zander says no, he doesn't because he's afraid of his space weed being eaten, TheBlade.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:47 PM)_

> I know what you use it for.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:47 PM)_

> Guys, we literally just landed a couple hours ago, we cant just shoot into the trees.

_Jim shivers._

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:47 PM)_

_Seth takes down his laser rifle._

> I'll have you know, women enjoy having it in their asshole.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:48 PM)_

> Too much, Seth.

> Too much.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:48 PM)_

_Jim pinches his nose and sighs._

> That is a thing I did not need to live with hearing.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:48 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett get out of the ship to inquire the weird man cat demon thing?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 03:48 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:48 PM)_

> The hell is that?

_Jim smushes his face into a window to get a better view of the tiefling._

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:48 PM)_

_Emmett exits the ship and walks up to Lucian._

> Yeah, so my friend was going to shoot you.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:49 PM)_

_Seth follows, folding his arms._

> No I wasn't!
> You were!

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 03:49 PM)_

> I see, well thank you for telling him not to.
> I'd rather not die.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:50 PM)_

> Your life was dependent on space weed.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:50 PM)_

_Jim walks out as well._

> And ass bongs!

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:50 PM)_

> My name's Emmett.

_Emmett puts a hoof out._

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:50 PM)_

> Intergalactic grass.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 03:50 PM)_

_Lucian shakes Emmett's hoof._

> Im Lucian, Its nice to meet you.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:51 PM)_

> Are we literally talking to some kind of cat fucker hiding in the woods?

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:51 PM)_

_Emmett stares at Jim in annoyance._

> And I'm a literal goat man. Your point?

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:51 PM)_

> I mean, thats normal though.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 03:51 PM)_

> I'm not a cat, robot man.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:51 PM)_

> Anyways, I'm assuming you took an interest in us?

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 03:52 PM)_

> I did, I wanted to ask something.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:52 PM)_

_Jim looks up Lucian's public record using the old police database he still has access to._

> And I'm not a robot, Lucian Blackwater.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 03:53 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Lucian go and wake Bail up?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 03:53 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Arky.

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 03:53 PM)_

_Bail wakes up, not feeling Lucian's slap._

> Who are you?

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:53 PM)_

> He's a demon human cat thing. Duh.

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 03:54 PM)_

> I see.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 03:54 PM)_

> Im a tiefling.

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 03:54 PM)_

> Oh.

_Baill shrugs._

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:54 PM)_

> Ok, I know that this guy basically has no criminal record, but why are we letting him go near one of our guys to slap him awake?

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:54 PM)_

> Meh.

_Seth stares in the distance at a woman on the sidewalk._

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 03:54 PM)_

> Anyway, I wanted to know if I can join you guys on your journey.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:55 PM)_

> He's just the mechanic, who cares.

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 03:55 PM)_

_Bail tilts his head._

> Wait, he slapped me?

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:55 PM)_

> Odd, why?
> We're really cramped.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:55 PM)_

> We'll get an upgrade in a bit.
> I know a guy.

_Seth messes with his watch to find out where his "guy" was located._

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:55 PM)_

> Like, it's-hard-to-take-a-shit-in-privacy kind-of cramped.

_Emmett folds his arms._

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:55 PM)_

> I think I know a better place.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 03:56 PM)_

> Its a promise I made to someone that I would see space for them.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:56 PM)_

_Emmett mumbles to himself, thinking about whether Lucian would be a good fit in the crew._

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:56 PM)_

> Since we are in Detroit, there is a shipyard not too far from our location.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 03:56 PM)_

_Lucian takes out his wallet and takes a look, finding a couple of Ducketts._

> I dont have much money, but I can pay what I can...

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:56 PM)_

> Earth is literal garbage.

_Emmett is still sour over the subpar burgers Seth made him try out._

> Let's not get an upgrade here.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:57 PM)_

> Emmett, We need to head to Mora-Norap's mechanic's shop on the way to the next space station.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:57 PM)_

> Hey, we need some space, and what you have is honestly a piece of garbage!

_Jim scowls._

> A new ship would be good.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:58 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth go out looking for a woman to charm?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 03:58 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:58 PM)_

> Don't you dare call our ship a piece of crap, man.

_Emmett balls up his hooves._

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:58 PM)_

> It's a vintage.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:58 PM)_

> We've used this baby for GUYs.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:58 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Jim start heading towards the shipyard?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 03:58 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:59 PM)_

> I'll see you guys when I get back with a REAL ship.

_Jim spits at the crew demeaningly._

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 03:59 PM)_

> This ship is a 2990 Monoplacate Classic.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 03:59 PM)_

> Unless you want to come.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 03:59 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett, rather than go to the shipyard, stick his tongue out at Jim?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 03:59 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, Zander.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:00 PM)_

> Dude.
> We have ducketts for days.
> I think.
> How many do we have, Seth?

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:00 PM)_

_Seth pulls up the crew's balance on his watch._

> 13,000.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:00 PM)_

> Oh, I'm not planning on BUYING a ship.

_Jim rubs his hands together maliciously._

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:01 PM)_

> We're not getting a new ship.

_Seth scrunches up his face._

> That's retarded.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:01 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Lucian grabs onto Jim's shirt with his scythe?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:01 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Arky.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:01 PM)_

_Jim backs up in surprise at Seth's contempt._

> It would be good to get a second one at least.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:01 PM)_

> We'll just get an upgrade.
> It'd be better.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:01 PM)_

_Lucian pulls Jim back with his scythe._

> Where are you going?

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:01 PM)_

_Jim, in surprise, puts a hand on his shotgun._

> OK, THIS IS WHY I DIDNT LIKE THIS GUY!

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:02 PM)_

> Plus, I know the right guy for this.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:02 PM)_

> Can we NOT grab me?

_Jim looks at the others for help, and then at Lucian._

> I mean you.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:02 PM)_

> A proper teammate wouldnt leave his team to find something new, but would help his team upgrade!

_Lucian's eyes flash white for a moment, anime-style._

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:03 PM)_

_Seth ignores Jim's plight._

> We do a simple bounty for this guy, we'll be able to get it renovated.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:03 PM)_

> You don't abandon your team!

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:03 PM)_

_Emmett looks back at the busted up vintage ship for a while and frowns._

> Why don't we just get a new ship?

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:03 PM)_

> This is a classic.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:03 PM)_

> Let's not get it from here.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:03 PM)_

> I refuse.

_Seth shakes his head angrily._

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:03 PM)_

> Never said we can't keep this one.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:03 PM)_

_Jim grabs Lucian by his collar._

> And you aren't even in a "team"!

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:04 PM)_

> But let's face the facts, Seth, this ship has been in use since before I was born!

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:04 PM)_

> I'd rather do a mission for Mora-Norap.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:04 PM)_

_Jim complains in an accusatory tone._

> Oh, so now you're on MY side?

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 04:04 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Bail inspect the ship to see the damage?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Brakia.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:04 PM)_

> Does he sell cheap and relatively large ships?

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:05 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth convince everyone to do a mission for Mora-Norap?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:05 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Bagelwrecker.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:05 PM)_

_Lucian shoves Jim off of him._

> I know that you don't abandon your team, punk.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:05 PM)_

> He can.

_Seth puts a hand to his cheek and thinks for a moment._

> Depends on what mission we do.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:05 PM)_

> Cheap and pricey, everything good and bad.

_Jim points in the direction of the Detroit shipyard._

> Everything they sell is new.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:05 PM)_

> Screw getting a new ship on Earth though!

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:06 PM)_

_Jim puts a finger to Lucian's lips._

> We got better things than what you got right now, so shut it.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:06 PM)_

_Seth snaps back at Jim in a mocking tone._

> I'd get a better quality ship from a trash heap on Blue Vector 2-O9.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:07 PM)_

> Guys, relax.

_Emmett holds out his holodevice._

> I've been checking on my device for ships.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:07 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Jim take Lucian's scythe and throw it at the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, TheBlade.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:07 PM)_

> I think I know a good place that's not too far...

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:08 PM)_

_Seth relents, groaning._

> Look, as long as it's a vintage I'm fine.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:08 PM)_

> Bail, just come on man, you know that ship is a pice of crap.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:08 PM)_

@Magic8ball Is the advertisement that Emmett finds truthful?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:08 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:08 PM)_

> Just... I love this ship...

_Seth walks over to the ship and rubs a hand over it, reminiscing over good times._

> I've boned so many women on here...

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:09 PM)_

_Emmett watches a police cruiser race on by, unrelated to their troubles on Earth._

> Jim, I know your place might be good, but we've got to go man.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:09 PM)_

> Can this thing get off of me for a second?

_Jim tries to get the scythe out of his shirt and manages to rip it a bit more._

> I'm not going anywhere with this thing on me.`

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:09 PM)_

> Earth sucks, and more importantly, the law sucks here.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:10 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Lucian take the scythe out of Jim's shirt?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:10 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | N0, Arky.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:11 PM)_

_Emmett stomps over to Lucian._

> Dude.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:11 PM)_

> Can someone help me with Lucian?

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:11 PM)_

> If you want on the ship, take it out of him.

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 04:11 PM)_

@Magic8ball

> Does Bail stick around with Jim and Lucian?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 04:12 PM)_

> I'm headed with you two, wherever you're going.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:13 PM)_

> Fine.

_Lucian takes the scythe out of Jim's shirt._

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:13 PM)_

@Magic8ball Do Seth look at the missions?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:14 PM)_

_As the tension diffuses, Emmett walks off to the ship._

> We're getting on the ship, guys.
> Don't leave us.

@Magic8ball Is Emmett getting onto the ship as he says this?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, Zander.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:15 PM)_

@Magic8ball

> Does Lucian follow behind Emmett?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, Arky.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:16 PM)_

> Fine, we will get a new ship though.

_Jim begrudingly gets on the ship._

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:16 PM)_

_Emmett starts heading to the cockpit._

> You think the place is nice, Seth?

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:16 PM)_

_Seth, having followed Emmett, mutters to him._

> I think so.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:16 PM)_

> Whats the name of it?

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:17 PM)_

_Emmett looks up at his elf daddy._

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:17 PM)_

_Seth smirks._

> Mora-Norap's Son's Cheap Ships.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:17 PM)_

> Coincidental, at most.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:17 PM)_

> I'm sure...

_Seth giggles to himself._

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 04:18 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Bail head to the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | N0, Brakia.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:18 PM)_

> Are we going to buy or steal?

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:18 PM)_

_Emmett gets a headcount by checking the crew's vitals and notices Bail is not on the ship. He sighs and speaks into comms._

> Bail, get on man.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:18 PM)_

> Buy.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:18 PM)_

> Buy. We're not criminals.
> Usually.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:18 PM)_

> I mean, we are already wanted for murder...

_Jim grimaces._

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:18 PM)_

> On Earth we are.
> He used to be my old partner, I prefer not wronging him.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:19 PM)_

> Armed robbery, theft, assault with a deadly weapon, kidnapping, and breaking and entering...

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:19 PM)_

_Seth ignores Jim and smiles at his son._

> He didn't like me taking you in, remember that Emmett?

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:20 PM)_

> Oh. Yeah.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:20 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does everyone get in the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:20 PM)_

> Now I remember the dude.

_Emmett looks up in thought._

> We nearly killed his sister.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:20 PM)_

_Jim, annoyed at Seth, decides to make stuff up about him._

> Wait, it says Seth has multiple accounts of rape too...

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:21 PM)_

> I don't though.
> I get consent before sex.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:21 PM)_

> Dont tell me, ask the system.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:21 PM)_

> I mean, do you think he dislikes me?

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:22 PM)_

> I don't think he does.
> Just stay in the background, I'll do the talking.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:22 PM)_

> This was a loong time ago.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:22 PM)_

t!choose 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 20 |

**Tatsumaki** _(27-Jun-18 04:22 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | TheBlade, I pick 20!

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:22 PM)_

> He'll remember.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:22 PM)_

> I barely remember the dude.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:22 PM)_

_Jim furiously adds fake charges of rape under Seth's name into the police system._

> It seems you have 20 counts of rape on the system.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:23 PM)_

_Seth slaps Jim lightly, tired of hearing about Earth._

> Whatever, your planet's laws are retarded.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:23 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett launch the ship towards the place?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:23 PM)_

> Pays well enough.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:24 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett now launch the ship towards the place?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, Arky.

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 04:25 PM)_

@Magic8ball

> Does Bail check on the ship's systems?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:25 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Brakia.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:25 PM)_

> Bail, you coming with us? Might as well get accustomed with the new ship.

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 04:26 PM)_

_Bail enters the cockpit, foregoing his duties of ship maintenance._

> Sure. I need to get accustomed to the new ship.`

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:26 PM)_

> Knowing him he'll want us to do a few missions for him, that's if we want the ship for free.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:26 PM)_

_Lucian looks out the window and smiles as the ship takes off._

> Wow, I can't believe I'm actually doing this!

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:27 PM)_

> What, never been off-planet?

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:27 PM)_

> How about we do two missions and split off? 50% you think?

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:27 PM)_

> Maybe.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:28 PM)_

> Not for us to decide, Up to Mora-Norap.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:28 PM)_

> Unless we get a big mission.

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:28 PM)_

> I've never been off planet!

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:28 PM)_

> Maybe we'll kill a space dictator.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:29 PM)_

> That would be amusing.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:29 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the crew get to Mora-Norap's Shipyard?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Brakia says yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:29 PM)_

> Well, time to go then.

_Emmett pops open the shiphatch after the ship gets to the shipyard and lands._

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:29 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Mora have a 20% discount for Earth-based police?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | NO, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:30 PM)_

_Jim looks at what he was wearing worryingly._

> Does anyone have any spare clothing I can take? It might be strange seeing a Earth-Cop up here.`

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:31 PM)_

> I don't think many would realize your status.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:31 PM)_

_Seth wags his finger in Jim's direction before exiting the ship._

> None that would fit you.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:31 PM)_

> Probably would if you're an important person though.
> But not a cop.
> Cops here are strange.

_Emmett tilts his head._

> One time I saw Seth getting arrested by a cop with barely any clothing.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:32 PM)_

> Meh.
> That was a hooker.

_Seth laughs._

> Not a cop.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:32 PM)_

> She kinda told me to go back to-

_Emmett's face immediately switched to a grimace._

> Fuck.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:33 PM)_

_Jim takes out his measurement implant and measures Seth's height._

> Seth, you are approximately two inches taller than my current height.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:34 PM)_

_Seth shrugs._

> I'm also skinnier than you.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:34 PM)_

@Magic8ball Do the crew move over to Norap?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:34 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:34 PM)_

> You dont have any clothing at all that would be slightly larger?

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:34 PM)_

@Magic8ball Do the crew move over to Norap?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:34 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Maybe, Arky.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:34 PM)_

> I only have two pairs of clothing.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:35 PM)_

_Emmett gags at the thought of having only two pairs of clothes._

> One for charming and one for fucking.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:35 PM)_

_Jim pinches his nose._

> That explains the stench.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:35 PM)_

_Seth sees Jacob dragging behind, a waft of feces emanating from him._

> That's Jacob.

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 04:36 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Bail explore the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:36 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, Brakia.

**TheBlade** _(27-Jun-18 04:36 PM)_

> Can we just land this thing?

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:36 PM)_

_The crew enters the shipyard's main entrance._

> Alright, here's your dude, Seth.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:36 PM)_

> Mora!
> How's my favorite slimeling doing?

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:37 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: Hey Seth.

_`Mora-Norap`: Mora pushes in the drawer to his cash register and laughs boisterously._

> `Mora-Norap`: How are you doing?

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:37 PM)_

> I'm doing alright, just looking for a new vintage ship.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:38 PM)_

_Emmett whispers, holding his ears._

> He's a little loud.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:38 PM)_

> Polonot is getting older and parts are getting scarcer.

_Seth stoops to Emmett's level momentarily and whispers back to him._

> He is, but get used to it.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:38 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: I got just the ship for ya.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:39 PM)_

> Capacity of nine or more?

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:40 PM)_

_Luccian follows behind the group, observing their interaction with Mora-Norap._

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:40 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: This is a 2987 Maronoa Masive. It's got 11 rooms, 1 bathroom and a living room.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:41 PM)_

> Have anything relatively newer?

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:42 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: I deal vintage ships, not those fancy newer models kid.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:43 PM)_

> Ah, I see.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:43 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: I'll give you a discount Seth, considering I've known you long enough.

t!choose 10 percent off | 20 percent off | 30 percent off | 40 percent off | 50 percent off

**Tatsumaki** _(27-Jun-18 04:44 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | Bagelwrecker, I pick 30 percent off!

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:44 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: I'll sell it to ya' for 12,000 D's

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:44 PM)_

> Mind going a tiny bit lower?
> Maybe 11,500?

@Magic8ball Does the slimeling agree?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Zander says He barters for 11,750 D, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:46 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett try to assist in the bartering?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:47 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase no, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:47 PM)_

> I think we might be able to do that.
> Emmett?

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:47 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Lucian try to assist in the bartering?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:47 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yeah, Arky.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:47 PM)_

_Emmett is off-put by the expensive price._

> Yeah, I mean we could but...

**Arky** _(27-Jun-18 04:48 PM)_

_Lucian butts in, leaning into the counter._

> Can you go 11,000 D? You said he was your friend and you've known each other for awhile...

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:48 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: That'd be stealing kid, he's getting 30% off for it too.
> `Mora-Norap`: Don't try ta' push your luck.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:49 PM)_

> While we do have the funds for it, we'd be kind-of broke...

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:50 PM)_

_Seth stares behind Norap at a bulletin board. He raises an eyebrow inquisitively._

> You got a 11,750 D mission for us?

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:50 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap` A little high of a mission but I may have just the thing...

**Brakia** _(27-Jun-18 04:50 PM)_

@Magic8ball Will the man give us the ship for half off due to the group's charm?

**Magic8Ball** _(27-Jun-18 04:50 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yeah, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:52 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: There's been a guy pushin' into my territory, push him out of the business and I'll give ya' the ship.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:52 PM)_

> You want him dead?

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:52 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: If possible, sure.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:53 PM)_

_Emmett sighs and nudges Seth._

> Why does everything have to be about killing, man?

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:53 PM)_

> Because, if we scare him away he'll just make a new business somewhere else.
> We can also maybe steal some money and parts.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:54 PM)_

> Fine.

**Bagelwrecker** _(27-Jun-18 04:54 PM)_

> We'll take the mission.

**Zander** _(27-Jun-18 04:54 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes and mutters sarcastically._

> I'll enact in murderous space capitalism.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:13 PM)_

> So, are we going to get going?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:13 PM)_

> Yeah, we'll head out.
> I got the coordinates.

@Magic8ball Do we head out?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:14 PM)_

> Any reason why we're waiting?

@Magic8ball Does Emmett look a little impatient?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:14 PM)_

> Just remembered I need some ammo.

_Seth turns to Mora-Norap and buys some ammunition from him._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:15 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Bail check the ship's programs and make sure it's ready to fly?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yeah, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:16 PM)_

> I'm off to check the ship's systems.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:17 PM)_

_`Mora-Norap`: Mora, wanting to see Seth squirm a bit, decides to screw with him._

> `Mora-Norap`: Also, you'll need to take this one with you.

_`Mora-Norap`: Mora flicks a switch, causing a wormhole disruptor to light up, which teleports an unsuspecting traveler to the shipyard._

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:18 PM)_

> Saturn looks brilliant tonight, but I am so lonely.

@Magic8ball Does Maia get teleported to the shipyard?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, Mica.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:19 PM)_

> Oh great, another passenger.

_Seth rolls his eyes._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:19 PM)_

> Well then.
> Hello, stranger.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:20 PM)_

> Uhh..

_Maia looks around, worried about the predicament she's now in._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:20 PM)_

_Seth shakes off any interest he has in the space centaur and redirects his attention back to Mora._

> Are we doing a transport mission for you Mora?

> I'll have to charge a little bit extra for that.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:21 PM)_

> Alright I'm back, everything seems in order. Wait... Did you guys pick up another passenger?

_Bail taps the ground impatiently._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:21 PM)_

> Well, I'm Emmett. Pilot of this hunk of junk. And you are?

_Emmett holds his hoof out in greetings._

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:22 PM)_

_Maia shuffles about, not sure what to think about what is going on._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:22 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth convince Mora to let the crew have a slightly larger ship for the time being?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Wait to ask this again, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:23 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Mora give the crew a larger ship temporarily?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Zander.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:23 PM)_

> I, um...

_Maia fidgets shyly._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:24 PM)_

_Seth's head turns backwards to look at Maia for half a second before reverting forward._

> Mhmm, cool.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:24 PM)_

> Uhm.. Yeah.

_Emmett puts down his hand from the awkward tension._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:26 PM)_

> Emmett. Whenever possible, we need to pick up some ammo from Glorpo Zorpo, I know how much you dislike him but we he's one of the few people that sells .60 caliber bullets.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:26 PM)_

> Maia. Celestial Guardian of the Stars.

_Maia's cheeks blush intensely._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:26 PM)_

_Emmett keeps his focus on the centaur._

> Ah, Zorpo.
> That guy.
> And it's nice to meet you, Maia.

_Emmett scratches the back of his head._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:27 PM)_

_Seth mumbles angrily as he and the crew, along with Maia, decide to head back to the ship._

> Very nice, welcome aboard the most crowded ship in the world.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:27 PM)_

> My name is Bail. I'm the mechanic of this group.

_Bail tips his hat._

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:27 PM)_

> I.. just so happened to um... teleport here.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:28 PM)_

_Emmett did not pay attention to what Mora did, so he was confused as well._

> Any particular reason?

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:28 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Maia randomly get a wing boner?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:28 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yay, Mica.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:28 PM)_

> Are you hurt, or something?

_Emmett gets decked from the sudden extension of Maia's wings._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:29 PM)_

> I'm going to go pack my stuff up.

_Seth, clearly uninterested, heads forward._

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:29 PM)_

> Oh my Orion! I'm so sorry!

_Maia holds her face in embarrassment._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:29 PM)_

> I mean, they just got in my face. no biggy.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:30 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth go into the cockpit and pack up the crew's various souvenirs?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:30 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Maybe, Bagelwrecker.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:30 PM)_

> Sorry sorry! I-I'll put them back.. I just get so shy around new beings...

_Maia slowly contracts her wings._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:30 PM)_

@Magic8ball

> Does Emmett try to push her wing out of the way to get to the small and crowded ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:30 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:31 PM)_

> It's fine.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:31 PM)_

> These things are heavy.

_Emmett quickly passes by Maia._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:31 PM)_

> Emmett, don't be rude.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:31 PM)_

> What? I'm just being honest.
> Honesty is the first squirtue.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:31 PM)_

> Aah... Hhh...

_Maia blushes and hides her face._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:32 PM)_

> Who knows, maybe she's self conscious of her wing weight?

_Seth returns to wherever Emmett is to slap him._

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:32 PM)_

> They're sensitive...

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:32 PM)_

> Oh.

_Emmett backs up, feeling guilty._

> Uhm, sorry.
> I won't ever do that again.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:32 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Bail head back to the ship to escape this awkward situation?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:32 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:33 PM)_

> I'm concerned.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:33 PM)_

> Anyways you two have fun, I'm going to pack up our stuff, I'll leave your little squoat doll for you.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:33 PM)_

_Emmett kicks at Seth's shins as he walks away._

> It's not a doll!

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:33 PM)_

@Magic8ball Will Maia use her celestial aura to calm down and collect herself?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:33 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, Mica.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:34 PM)_

> Squoall, doll, same difference.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:34 PM)_

> That was a horror show.

_Bail holds his head._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:34 PM)_

> What the hell is a squoall?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:34 PM)_

> Plus I have no clue what you do to that thing at night.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:34 PM)_

> Wow that is not how I planned this day to go. Anyway... where is this ship headed?

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:34 PM)_

_Emmett's brow drops in annoyance._

> It's a treasure my squom made for me, you perv.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:35 PM)_

> We're on a mission, but that's the most I know.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:35 PM)_

_Seth peers around the corner at Maia and Bail._

> We're heading to a used ship shop and scaring him away.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:35 PM)_

> We might need a sniper or two.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:35 PM)_

> Nah.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:35 PM)_

> If things get hairy.
> Think about it. This is his competition.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:35 PM)_

> I'll just shoot him.

_Seth shrugs._

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:36 PM)_

> I am a sniper.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:36 PM)_

_Bail literally lights up, his Novakid gasses brightening at the sound of a kindred soul._

> Really? Me too.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:36 PM)_

> Oh cool! Would you like to see my rifle?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:37 PM)_

> Disgusting.

_Seth sneers._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:37 PM)_

> Well, we're in the ship then.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:37 PM)_

> Sure. I always like to see other's choices.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:37 PM)_

@Magic8ball

> Does Seth start packing up?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Maybe, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:38 PM)_

@Magic8ball

> Does Emmett drag the elf into the cockpit with him?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 5! No, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:40 PM)_

_Seth air humps._

> Swag money.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:40 PM)_

> Here...

_Maia pulls out her lengthy pearlescent sniper rifle._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:40 PM)_

_Seth tilts his head at the sight._

> Jeez' that must of cost a lot of Ducketts.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:40 PM)_

_Bail gasps in awe._

> Oh wow.... this thing is a work of art.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:41 PM)_

> Made from the pearls of Neptune...

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:41 PM)_

> Amazing...

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:41 PM)_

_Emmett heads over to his room and starts to pack._

> Doodie doodie doo, packing up for me and you.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:42 PM)_

> Please don't touch my posters.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:42 PM)_

> My sniper is just a family heirloom. Nothing special about it.

_Bail sighs._

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:43 PM)_

> That makes it that much more special. Family is important to many.

_Maia smiles softly._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:44 PM)_

> Yeah. My grandfather would talk about the day he saw his grandfather make it.
> For him, it seemed like magic.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:45 PM)_

@Magic8ball Do Bail pull out his sniper as he reminisces?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:45 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Brakia.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:46 PM)_

> I bet yours is lovely.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:47 PM)_

> Quite the opposite, actually. It's just made out of oak wood and simple metals.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:47 PM)_

_Emmett moves over to Laav's area and looks around._

> Hey, can you guys get up here? I'm finding it hard to pack up the lava man's stuff.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:47 PM)_

> Did I forget to airlock his rockdoll?

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:47 PM)_

_Bail looks over to the hall and speaks loudly for Emmett to hear._

> Oh yeah. I'll be right there!

_Bail hands Maia her rifle back._

> Here's your sniper back.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:48 PM)_

> Thank you.

@Magic8ball Should Maia look around the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:48 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Mica.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:48 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth help Emmett?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:48 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Maybe, Bagelwrecker.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:49 PM)_

> Oh... The ship is nice...

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:49 PM)_

_Seth takes out a cheap can of beer and opens it._

> It's seen better days.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:49 PM)_

> A little small, if you ask me.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:50 PM)_

> I'll be sending it back home once we get the new ship.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:50 PM)_

_Maia ducks as her head almost hits the top of a doorway._

> Oof... just a little...

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:50 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett start up the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:50 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Zander.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:50 PM)_

> Still purring.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:51 PM)_

> Of course it is.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:51 PM)_

> Wonderful!

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:51 PM)_

> Serpile kept this ship in tip top shape.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:51 PM)_

> Who was Serpile?

_Bail enters into the cockpit, where Emmett and Seth are._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:51 PM)_

> Our last mechanic.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:51 PM)_

> Last mechanic.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:51 PM)_

> Oh...

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:51 PM)_

> Great mechanic.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:52 PM)_

> I guess I have a legacy to live up to.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:52 PM)_

> Unfortunate that he died.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:52 PM)_

> How did he die?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:52 PM)_

> He licked up some ancient piss.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:52 PM)_

> Oh my...

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:52 PM)_

> Oh. Okay then.

@Magic8ball Does Bail head to his cabin?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 05:53 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase no, Brakia.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:53 PM)_

> So what do you guys do..?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:54 PM)_

> Freelancers.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:54 PM)_

_Emmett shrugs._

> Explore the stars.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:54 PM)_

> Take missions, explore the universe, shoot up police stations. the usual stuff.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:54 PM)_

> And as for Seth, pillage.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:54 PM)_

> Well if you guys need a guys need a guide...
> I know the galaxy like the back of my hand.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:55 PM)_

> Meh, I don't pillage as much as I used to Emmett.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:55 PM)_

> Lucky us.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:56 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes._

> Pillage women.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:56 PM)_

> Mmm... You're right.

_Seth pets Emmett's head._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:56 PM)_

_Emmett shivers from Seth's petting and decides to ignore it._

> And a guide would be great, Maia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:56 PM)_

> I wouldn't mind it.
> As long as you aren't a moral guide.

_Seth laughs heartily._

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:57 PM)_

> Lovely. I am at your service.

_Maia bows._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:58 PM)_

> Best not to say that around Seth.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:58 PM)_

> Huh?

_Maia looks confused._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:58 PM)_

_Seth puts a hand to his chin and thinks about Maia, before making a decision._

> Nah.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 05:58 PM)_

_Emmett pulls Maia away from Seth._

> How about you just stick to us, Maia, and not the abnormally tall manslut.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:59 PM)_

> I'm not much interested in centaurs.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:59 PM)_

> Oh.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 05:59 PM)_

> No offense.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 05:59 PM)_

_Maia looks away in shame._

> It's okay. We aren't allowed to reproduce anyways.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 05:59 PM)_

> Allowed?

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:00 PM)_

> Celestial centaurs, at least.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:00 PM)_

_Seth slams on a table, upset at this knowledge._

> Airlock!
> So let's go to Glorpo Zorpo!

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:02 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Maia offer to direct them to Glorpo Zorpo?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nay, Mica.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:02 PM)_

> Not to be poking into your private business, but why can't you guys reproduce?

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:03 PM)_

> Well we are not created by the magic of reproduction, but born from a star. So we are infertile.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:03 PM)_

_Seth frowns._

> How interesting.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:04 PM)_

> Other species of centaur can reproduce, but celestals are a much different breed.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:05 PM)_

> That's a bit different from being not allowed though.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:05 PM)_

> Born from a star, huh? Sounds kind of like us Novakids.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:06 PM)_

> Novakids?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:06 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the crew head to Glorpo Zorpo's Gun Store?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:07 PM)_

> My race. Novakids are made of stardust, and are essentially stars in humanoid forms.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:07 PM)_

_After landing, the crew can see a large neon sign that reads, "Zorpo's", from the cockpit._

> Ugh. Zorpo.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:07 PM)_

> I know, I know.

_Seth pats Emmett's shoulder._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:07 PM)_

> Why did he have to make his base right next to a flipping star?

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:07 PM)_

> How interesting! So we are similar!

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:07 PM)_

_Seth shrugs._

> Keeps the cops away.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:07 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett put on sunglasses?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:08 PM)_

> Some of the stuff he sells is illegal.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:08 PM)_

> I'll head in. Just give me a list of what we need.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:08 PM)_

> He probably wouldn't like that...

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:08 PM)_

> Yeah, I'm not stepping foot in his place.

_Emmett leans on the ship._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:08 PM)_

> He's a little racist against non-elves.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:08 PM)_

> Oh.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:08 PM)_

> Nearly killed me the first time we met.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:09 PM)_

> Oh my.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:09 PM)_

> Mhmm.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:09 PM)_

> I'll head in.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:09 PM)_

> What type of ammo and guns do we need?

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:09 PM)_

> Get some energy modules for me please.

_Emmett takes out a lighter and some grass to smoke._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:10 PM)_

> I need some standard sniper ammo.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:10 PM)_

> Alright
> What caliber?

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:10 PM)_

> I'm good on ammo. If they have any stardust, please pick some up for me.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:11 PM)_

_Bail checks his pack._

> 22 caliber.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:11 PM)_

> Stardust is a little expensive, but I'll try.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:11 PM)_

> I can give you currency.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:11 PM)_

_Emmett props his backhooves on the navigational console._

> Don't be long, please.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:11 PM)_

> Will do.
> Just transfer it to our joint account, Maia.

_Seth exits the ship and into Zorpo's._

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:12 PM)_

_Maia accesses her account from a holodevice and makes the transaction._

> Done.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:12 PM)_

> Alright.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:12 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Bail head to his cabin?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:12 PM)_

> I'm headed to my cabin.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:12 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth buy everything the crew needs without incident?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 17! Yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:12 PM)_

> Nice to converse with you, Bail.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:12 PM)_

> As with you.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:13 PM)_

> Alright Glorpo.

_Seth waves at him._

> I'll see you around.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:13 PM)_

> Hey, Maia?

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:13 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Maia converse with Emmett?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yay, Mica.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:13 PM)_

> Yes?

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:13 PM)_

> I think I've seen you somewhere.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:13 PM)_

_Seth enters the ship and drops the bucketload of various ammunitions onto the kitchen counter._

> Alright I got everything, I spent a total of 12,000 D's.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:14 PM)_

_Maia tilts her head inquisitively._

> Is that so?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:14 PM)_

> We got like 5,000 D's left.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:14 PM)_

> Yeah. Wasn't there a fire or something?

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:15 PM)_

_Maia's smile drops._

> Oh yes... The fire.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:15 PM)_

> I swear that man charges way too much for stardust!

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:15 PM)_

> It feels so long ago, but so familiar.
> What planet was that on?

@Magic8ball Was it on Vortox-56?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Zander.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:16 PM)_

> Yes...

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:16 PM)_

> What?

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:17 PM)_

@Magic8ball

> Does Bail emerge from his cabin and join the crew?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:17 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 11! Yes, Brakia.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:17 PM)_

> I mean- Um... Vortox... 56.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:17 PM)_

> Hey, Seth's back. That was quick.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:17 PM)_

_Emmett tips his sunglasses to get a better look at Maia._

> My homeplanet?

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:18 PM)_

> I do believe so, yes.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:18 PM)_

> Alright let's head to Dick's Cheap Used Ships.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:18 PM)_

> Always hated that name.

_Bail groans._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:19 PM)_

> Well he is a space dick.

_Seth chuckles to himself._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:19 PM)_

> Are you saying that we met when I was only a teenager?

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:19 PM)_

> True, true.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:20 PM)_

> Perhaps. It must've been scary.

@Magic8ball Does Maia start to feel space sick?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Brakia says yes, Mica.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:21 PM)_

> Ugh... I don't feel so good...

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:21 PM)_

@Magic8ball Do we head to Dick's?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:22 PM)_

> Feeling sick?

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:22 PM)_

_Maia covers her mouth._

> Y-yeah...

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:22 PM)_

> Like, need a bucket or need a doctor?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:22 PM)_

> Don't worry, Emmett was like that on his first ride.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:22 PM)_

> Dude, I puked a lot on my first ride.
> The headrush from space, fire, and my whole family dying.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:23 PM)_

> May I have a bucket..?

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:23 PM)_

> Oh yeah. Coming back to me now.

_Emmett's smile fades._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:23 PM)_

> That was hilarious, Mora didn't like it though.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:23 PM)_

> I'll grab one.

_Bail grabs a bucket from the janitor's closet and heads back._

> Here you go.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:24 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett take the bucket from Bail and give it to Maia?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, Zander.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:25 PM)_

> Thank yo-

_Maia throws up purple slime into the bucket._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:25 PM)_

> _Emmett backs away and grimaces._

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:26 PM)_

> Hnn... I-I might need to lay down.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:26 PM)_

> First door on your left.
> Emmett hope you don't mind.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:27 PM)_

> Just don't look inside the closet.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:27 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the crew airlock the bucket?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:27 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | N0, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:27 PM)_

> I know, better than to look inside your closet.
> I know how you are without your grass.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:28 PM)_

> Okay.. Thank you.

_Maia heads down the hall and into Emmett's cabin._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:29 PM)_

_Emmett looks from side to side shiftily._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:29 PM)_

> Well then. Where are we headed again?

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:29 PM)_

> Uhm, I'm unsure now.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:30 PM)_

> Dick's Used Ship.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:30 PM)_

> Just spent a few minutes talking to the woman that I assisted in saving five GUY's ago.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:30 PM)_

> Huh. It's a small universe, after all.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:31 PM)_

_Seth pushes Emmett from his seat._

> We have a mission to do.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:31 PM)_

> Alright, alright. I'll get going.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:31 PM)_

@Magic8ball Shall Maia take a nap?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:31 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, Mica.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:31 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the crew head to Dick's?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:31 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Zander says yes but Seth does an Irish dance, Bagelwrecker.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:32 PM)_

> Ugh. I can't sleep.. I guess I can look around.

_Maia starts to snoop through Emmett's cabin._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:32 PM)_

_Seth does an irish jig._

> The ladies love it when I do this.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:32 PM)_

> I feel a little confused about things.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:32 PM)_

> Hmm. A closet.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:33 PM)_

@Magic8ball Is the crew there yet?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:33 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Wait to ask this again, Zander.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:33 PM)_

_Bail leans towards Emmett._

> So, what is in your closet?

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:35 PM)_

t!choose grass | grass | grass | a fake grass curtain | Serpile | grass | grass

**Tatsumaki** _(29-Jun-18 06:35 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | Zander, I pick grass!

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:36 PM)_

> Nothing important.

_Emmett sits back in his chair, crossing his arms._

> To you.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:36 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Bail check on Maia, as well as check what is in the closet?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:36 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, Brakia.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:37 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Maia open the closet?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Mica.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:37 PM)_

_Bail leans into the doorway to Emmett's cabin._

> Hey. How are you feeling?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:37 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the crew arrive at Dick's?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:37 PM)_

@Magic8ball Is there something else in the closet?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:37 PM)_

_Seth speaks over the ship intercom._

> We're here.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:38 PM)_

> I'm feeling much better. Also the purple slime can be used as fuel if you guys need it...

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:38 PM)_

> Really?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:38 PM)_

> Hurry up with whatever you're doing and lets go kill Dick.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:38 PM)_

_Emmett puts his wrist to his mouth, speaking directly to Seth through his comms._

> Dude, relax.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:38 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Bail open the closet?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, Brakia.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:39 PM)_

> You are looking in his closet?

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:39 PM)_

_Emmett and Seth meet up near the exit hatch._

> We need them two for sniping, don't we?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:39 PM)_

> Nah.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:39 PM)_

> Yeah. I never could resist a good mystery.
> However...

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:39 PM)_

_Maia peers in the closet._

> Hmm. Grass?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:39 PM)_

> I got my revolver and laser pistol.

_Seth flips his revolver around his finger expertly._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:39 PM)_

> It's just some grass.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:40 PM)_

> Interesting...

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:40 PM)_

> You have your crossbow thing.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:40 PM)_

_Emmett takes out his crossbow and pops open its module cache._

> Alright. Can you toss me the modules?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:40 PM)_

> Yep, here ya' go.

_Seth tosses some energy modules to Emmett, who catches them._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:41 PM)_

> Thanks.

_Emmett works on getting some of the modules inserted into the cache._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:41 PM)_

> No problem.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:41 PM)_

_Maia gets closer to the closet._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:41 PM)_

> Now let's head out and do our job.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:41 PM)_

> I smell something...

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:41 PM)_

> Hey mechanic, come and help us kill Dick!

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:41 PM)_

> I think he's fine.

_Emmett opens up the hatch._

> Let's do this thing.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:42 PM)_

> Alright.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:42 PM)_

@Magic8ball Should Maia look behind the curtain?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:42 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Mica.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:42 PM)_

@Magic8ball Do Seth and Emmett leave the ship and enter the dealership building?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:42 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | N0, Bagelwrecker.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:42 PM)_

> I think we should leave it alone...

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:43 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett instead go out first, acting as a lookout?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:43 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Zander.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:43 PM)_

> Nothing bad out here.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:43 PM)_

> I don't know... I can't resist a good secret.

_Bail enters the closet and digs through the grass._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:43 PM)_

> Keep that crossbow holstered.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:43 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Bail find out what is behind the grass?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:43 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:43 PM)_

> Don't need the cops on us immediately.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:44 PM)_

> OH...

_Maia gasps._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:44 PM)_

> Is that a dead body?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:44 PM)_

_Hearing Bail through comms, Seth interjects, pulling his watch closer to him._

> No, it's fertilizer.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:44 PM)_

> OH MY GOODNESS...

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:44 PM)_

> You think the cops would be c-what?!

_Emmett's eyes widen in bewilderment._

> There's a dead body on the ship?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:45 PM)_

> Umm...

_Seth shrugs._

> Yes and no.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:45 PM)_

_Bail pushes some grass aside to get a better look at the corpse._

> It's an argonian...

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:45 PM)_

> Yes and no?!

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:45 PM)_

> I'm gonna faint.

_Maia holds herself steady in disgust._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:45 PM)_

> Yes because Serpile's body wasn't airlocked but now he's fertilizer for your grass.
> So, yes and no.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:45 PM)_

_Emmett scoffs._

> That's fucking sick, man.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:46 PM)_

> THIS is what happened to your last mechanic?!

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:46 PM)_

> I thought we agreed to airlock it!

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:46 PM)_

> We did.
> Rockman refused

_Seth puts his fingers in the air for air quotes._

> He claimed we needed a "proper burial".

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:46 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Maia yeet out of the room?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Brakia says both Maia and Bail do, Mica.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:47 PM)_

_Emmett stops walking for a bit._

> Guys, hold up...

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:47 PM)_

> I'm out of here.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:47 PM)_

> Let's get out of here!

_Bail and Maia abscond the corpse closet and head out of Emmett's cabin._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:47 PM)_

> Did you guys find Serpile in my closet?

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:48 PM)_

> Y-Y-yeah...

_Maia was shivering in fear._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:48 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth continue on with the mission?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:48 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:48 PM)_

> Damnit, Seth.
> Now we have to mess with a corpse.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:48 PM)_

> What the hell was your old mechanic doing in your closet?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:48 PM)_

_Seth rolls his eyes._

> Ladies don't like the smell of dead bodies, Emmett.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:49 PM)_

> We apparently didn't airlock him like we were supposed to.

_Emmett puts his arms out, ready to argue with Seth, but decides against it, putting them back. His brow furrows._

> Screw you, man.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:49 PM)_

> It's a bigger problem than what ladies like!

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:49 PM)_

@Magic8ball

> Does Emmett dig though his grassy closet to pick up the argonian?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:49 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Bagelwrecker says no, but the argonian comes back alive and runs into the dealership screaming, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:49 PM)_

_Seth groans._

> Rockman claimed that if we airlocked him, he'd leave the crew.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:50 PM)_

> I highly doubt that...

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:51 PM)_

_`Serpile`: Serpile manages to revive momentarily and runs out of the ship in an absolute craze, howling for his life._

> `Serpile`: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:52 PM)_

_Emmett just watches Serpile run to Dick's in pure silence, startled._

> Damn...

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:52 PM)_

> I'm so confused.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:52 PM)_

> Our cover is going to be blown.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:52 PM)_

> The perfect distraction, let's do it.

_Seth holds his revolver above his head and moves forward._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:52 PM)_

> I'll grab him!

_Bail runs out the ship, hoping to catch Serpile._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:52 PM)_

> Alright, alright.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:53 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Maia go back and look into the closet?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:53 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Mica.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:53 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth rush in and convince Dick's daughter to come with him?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:53 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:53 PM)_

> Slow down!

_Bail manages to catch up with Serpile._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:53 PM)_

> `Serpile`: Who are you?

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:53 PM)_

> I'm the new mechanic.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:54 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett sneak behind the screaming man, taking his crossbow out if necessary?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:54 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, Zander.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:55 PM)_

> `Serpile`: New mechanic? They ditched me?

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:55 PM)_

> You died!

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:55 PM)_

> `Serpile`: That's not my fault!

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:55 PM)_

_Seth and Emmett sneak behind Serpile._

> Next time don't lick piss up off a sleeping bird.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:55 PM)_

_Emmett whispers to Seth._

> It's beautiful when you have a secret weapon to just walk behind, is it not?

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:56 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Bail tackle Serpile to the ground?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:56 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:56 PM)_

_Seth whispers back._

> I'll show Dick's daughter my secret weapon if ya know what I'm saying.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:56 PM)_

_Emmett nudges Seth in jest._

> Not if Maia chops it off.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:57 PM)_

_Maia, having been given a communicator earlier, manages to listen in right when her name is mentioned._

> What..?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:57 PM)_

> I'll pray to the love goddess, she'll give it back.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:57 PM)_

_Bail tackles Serpile to the ground, trying to calm him._

> Now, we need you to calm down.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:57 PM)_

> `Serpile`: Ok. Ok. I can calm down.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:57 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Maia faint?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:57 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Mica.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:58 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth bone Dick's daughter?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 06:58 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Zander says Seth doesn't know where she is yet, so no, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:58 PM)_

_Emmett gets a little aroused thinking about Maia._

> Maybe I'll show her my "secret weapon" while you're praying.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:58 PM)_

_Bail looks up at Seth, still holding down Serpile._

> What do we do with this guy?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:59 PM)_

> Eat him!

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 06:59 PM)_

> Uhm, don't do that.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:59 PM)_

> We're running out of meat.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 06:59 PM)_

_Maia coughs loudly, wheezing._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:59 PM)_

_Bail tilts his head in confusion._

> Umm, no?

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 06:59 PM)_

> `Serpile`: Please don't...

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 06:59 PM)_

> Then we'll airlock him.
> We need only one mechanic.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:00 PM)_

> He's still alive!

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:00 PM)_

> So what?

_Emmett facepalms._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:00 PM)_

> `Serpile`: I don't want to die! Again!

_`Serpile` Serpile starts to squirm restlessly beneath Bail._

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 07:00 PM)_

_Maia nearly pukes in her mouth._

> Can we just get the ship?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:00 PM)_

_Seth holds his hands out mockingly, jeering at Serpile._

> Wah wah wah, no one cares, zombie man.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:00 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the transformation begin?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:00 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Zander says slowly, Bail and Serpile are fusing into one, Brakia.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:01 PM)_

> Shut up, Seth.

_Emmett shoves Seth for being rude._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:01 PM)_

> Wait...

_Bail shakes his arm, not feeling anything in it._

> I can't feel my arm!

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:01 PM)_

> Anyways Emmett, go look for Dick and kill him

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:02 PM)_

_Emmett ignores Seth and speaks into his watch._

> Maia, you hear me? I'm speaking through the comms.

**Mica** _(29-Jun-18 07:02 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Maia do something important for the plot?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Maybe, Mica.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:02 PM)_

> Someone tell me what's going on?!

_Bail and Serpile start to vibrate violently._

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:03 PM)_

_Jim walks out of ship and observes his surroundings._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:03 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth find Dick's daughter, bone her, then find Dick and kill him?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:03 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 14! Yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:03 PM)_

_Emmett follows and watches in horror, unable to look away._

> Why do you always have to have sex with everyone?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:04 PM)_

> Because Space Rule 34: Don't kill a father before you fuck his daughter.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:04 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett ready his laser crossbow?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:05 PM)_

_Seth and Emmett make it to Dick's office, and Seth points his revolver at Dick._

> This is your death sentence Dick, I already boned your daughter. I now enact Space Rule 35.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:05 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the transformation fully complete yet?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:05 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 5! No, Brakia.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:05 PM)_

> `Dick`: I don't accept.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:05 PM)_

> Oh.
> Well, too bad.

_Seth cocks the revolver._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:05 PM)_

> `Dick`: Rather, you should accept your death.

@Magic8ball Does Dick release a whole bunch of alien hounds after Seth?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | N0, Zander.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:06 PM)_

_Bail is shaking uncontrollably._

> I've started to lose feeling in my legs!

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:06 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth shoot the man in the chest?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yay, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:06 PM)_

> You suck at fights.

_Seth blows the revolver's barrel._

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:06 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Jim walk into the complex?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, TheBlade.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:06 PM)_

> Please get better.

_Seth puts an 'L' to his forehead with his right index finger and thumb and dances._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:07 PM)_

@Magic8ball Was Dick wearing a bulletproof chest, an improved version of the vest?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yeah, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:07 PM)_

_Jim looks around, unable to see Dick's ship parts store right in front of him._

> Where the hell is everyone?

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:07 PM)_

_Bail tries to reach out to Jim, starting to melt into Serpile's melting body._

> Help me... please...

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:07 PM)_

> `Dick`: Where I don't have the weaponry, I am practically invincible.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:07 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Bail and Serpile's combination complete?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:08 PM)_

> Ok, I'll just bone your wife.
> Loser.

_Seth flips off Dick and heads to leave._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:08 PM)_

> `Dick`: Do it then.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:08 PM)_

_Jim searches for where the others are._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:08 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth shoot the man's legs off and run off to bone his wife?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:08 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:08 PM)_

> Watch me.

_Seth glares back at Dick._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:08 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth go bone his wife anyways?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:08 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:08 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Jim find the room where the fight is happening?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:08 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, TheBlade.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:08 PM)_

_There is nothing but a strange puddle where Bail and Serpile once were._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:09 PM)_

> I boned your daughter, I'll bone your wife!

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:09 PM)_

@Magic8ball Is his wife a mechanically reanimated corpse?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:09 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:09 PM)_

> HELLOOOOOOO? anyone?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:09 PM)_

> I'll bone them at the same time!

_Seth looks back at Dick's wife._

> Gross.

@Magic8ball Does Seth shoot the man's knees and run off to bone his wife and mother and daughter?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:11 PM)_

@Magic8ball Can Jim hack the camera system in the building to see where the rest of his team are?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Wait to ask this again, TheBlade.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:11 PM)_

@Magic8ball

> Does Emmett, who was conveniently hiding the whole time, sneak around behind Dick?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase no, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:11 PM)_

_Jim takes out his holodevice and tries to hack into the camera system._

> Fucking camera system has a firewall...

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:13 PM)_

@Magic8ball

> Does Dick find the hiding Emmett and grab him by the scruff of his neck?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:13 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett kill the man by shooting his Achilles' heel?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:13 PM)_

@Magic8ball Has Jim Completed the hack?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase no, TheBlade.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:13 PM)_

_Emmett, hiding, manages to impale Dick's neck with a clean shot from his laser crossbow. This kills Dick instantly._

> Cool.

_Emmett smiles at Seth, proud of himself._

> Like me.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:14 PM)_

> `What kind of a building needs this kind of security?`

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:14 PM)_

_Seth rolls his eyes._

> Shut up Emmett.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:14 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett find anything on Dick?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nay, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:14 PM)_

> We got women to airlock.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:14 PM)_

_Emmett checks Dick's pockets, finding nothing but pocket lint._

> This guy's broke.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:14 PM)_

> Break into the safe.

@Magic8ball Does Emmett break into the safe and find Dick's bank account info and credit card?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:15 PM)_

@Magic8ball

_Can Jim Hack into the camera system again to find everyone?_

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Zander says yes, but the camera room is literally right next door to Seth, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:16 PM)_

_Jim finally hacks into the camera system before realizing that the camera room is next to Seth._

> Oh, well that's nifty.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:17 PM)_

_Jim pops his head into Dick's office._

> Oh hey guys, have you seen Bail anywhere?

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:17 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett break into the safe and find an assload of ducketts?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:17 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | NO, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:18 PM)_

@Magic8ball

> Does Seth finish up and head back to Emmett to break into the safe?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Maybe, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:18 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Jim Walk over to the safe and pull the door off?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Bagelwrecker says no, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:19 PM)_

_Jim bangs on the safe door, trying to pull it off._

> Damn door is stuck tight.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:19 PM)_

> Be gentle with it.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:19 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett now break into the safe, finding a moldy hot dog?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Maybe, Zander.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:20 PM)_

`Ibraxas`: @Magic8ball Does Ibraxas enter the compound after reforming?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Zander says yes, but he turns into a marble and runs over Seth's foot and then turns back, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:21 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the group find a truckload of Ducketts?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Brakia says yes, but only if the marble thing never happened, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:21 PM)_

_Seth runs out to the warehouse and beats his chest, reaching a truck._

> AAAAAAAAAAAAA! OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

_The others follow behind him._

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:21 PM)_

> Wait guys, there are guards outside the building surrounding a...human?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:22 PM)_

t!choose 5,000 D | 6,000 D | 7,000 D | 8,000 D | 9,000 D | 10,000 D | 11,000 D | 12,000 D | 13,000 D |

**Tatsumaki** _(29-Jun-18 07:22 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | Bagelwrecker, I pick 9,000 D!

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

t!choose truckload of Ducketts | Tons of ammo | Blow up doll | 6 Lazer sharks | nothing | Keys to a ship | Mirror to alternate universe | broken ear ring

**Tatsumaki** _(29-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | TheBlade, I pick nothing!

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:24 PM)_

@Magic8ball Did Emmett already take what was in the safe somehow?

ðŸ¤” | Zander, I pick Keys to a ship!

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:24 PM)_

> We need to take care of those guards somehow.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:24 PM)_

> Nah.

_Seth turns back._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:25 PM)_

`Ibraxas`: @Magic8ball Does Ibraxas deal with the guards?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:25 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Bagelwrecker says no, but we leave unharmed and go back to Mora, Brakia.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:25 PM)_

> What do you mean "nah"?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:25 PM)_

> Told ya'.

_The crew and Ibraxas leave without resistance from any guards._

> Penis plan always works.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:26 PM)_

> Hey, if those guards where not so occupied with this guy...

_Jim points at Ibraxas._

> We would have had a fight.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:27 PM)_

_Emmett glares at Seth._

> Seth, your penis is going to turn into a marble one day.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:27 PM)_

> No we wouldn't, I made Dick's mom, wife, and daughter fall in love with me.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:27 PM)_

_`Ibraxas`: Ibraxas, after having beat up most of the guards, heads back to the others, taking a look at the keys Emmett got._

> `Ibraxas`: What about the ship those keys go to?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:27 PM)_

> They let the guards let us through. Now we airlock them.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:27 PM)_

> Thank god we didnt take them with us.

_Jim turns to Ibraxas in curiosity._

> Also, who the hell are you?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:28 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the crew airlock the women and the keys?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:28 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:28 PM)_

_Emmett pinches his snout._

> This dude smells like a pair of buttocks.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:28 PM)_

> You just appeared out of a puddle on the camera system.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:28 PM)_

_`Ibraxas`: Ibraxas looks at his hands, speaking as a fusion of two mechanics._

> I am Serpile, but I'm also Bail.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:28 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett keep the keys on him and walk off to the ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:28 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:29 PM)_

_The crew manages to make it back to Mora-Norap quickly._

> Bail was a novakid and you are not.
> So how the hell does that work?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:29 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: Ahh Seth, welcome back.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:29 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: Serpile was argonian, but I'm not that, either.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:29 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: Did you scare Dick away?

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:30 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: My name is...

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:30 PM)_

_Emmett mutters to himself._

> This Mora guy is pissing me off.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:30 PM)_

> We murdered him, so Yes.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:30 PM)_

`Ibraxas`: @Magic8ball Does Ibraxas think of his name yet?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:30 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Brakia.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:30 PM)_

> Starting to think that all of "you" are literaly just some kind of skin-changer.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:30 PM)_

_`Ibraxas`: Ibraxas pauses and thinks._

> `Ibraxas`: ...Ibraxas.`
`Ibraxas`: I am Ibraxas.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:30 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: Very good, very good.
> `Mora-Norap`: Here's the keys to the ship. I'll have your parents come pick up this one.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:31 PM)_

_Jim pokes Ibraxas, trying to figure him out._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:31 PM)_

> Hey, Mora?

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:31 PM)_

_`Ibraxas`: Ibraxas slaps away Jim._

> `Ibraxas`: Stop that.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:31 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: Yeah kid?

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:32 PM)_

> We got these keys to his ship. Think it'd be worth anything?

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:32 PM)_

> Hey, I mean it's not normal for a guy to literally have, oh I don't know, a SPECIES CHANGE?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:32 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: Hmmm...

_`Mora-Norap`: Mora grabs the keys and inspects them._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:32 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: To be honest, even I don't know what species I am.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:32 PM)_

> `Mora-Norap`: Ahh, a good ol' police cruiser.

@Magic8ball Does Mora buy the keys off of us for 700 Ducketts?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:33 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:34 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Seth suck his own dick while he gets the keys to the new ship and unlocks it?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:34 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:34 PM)_

_Seth grabs the keys and Ducketts from Mora and heads over to the new ship._

> Ah home sweet home...

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:35 PM)_

`Ibraxas`: @Magic8ball Does Ibraxas find his old box of tools in Bail's cabin?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:35 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Zander says yegayegayegayega, yes, Brakia.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:35 PM)_

> I can tell ya one thing, "Ibraxas". If you can change from form to form, then you might be a skin-changer of some kind, there have been a few back on Earth, but never encountered one myself...

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:35 PM)_

> Dibs on the second master bedroom.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:35 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the crew unpack everything and assign rooms?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:35 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nay, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:36 PM)_

_Emmett walks through the corridors of the ship, unfamiliar and cautious._

> Seth, I think we need to look around.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:36 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: I don't think i'm a skin-changer.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:36 PM)_

> Go ahead.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:36 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Jim secretly plant a bomb in the old ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:36 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yeah, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:36 PM)_

_Jim quickly heads back to the old ship and plants a bomb in it before heading back._

> Well guys, I think we better get going.
> New ship, new places, new lives. You know how it goes.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:37 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett take a peek in each room he finds?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:37 PM)_

> Nah.

_Seth falls back onto the bed in the cabin he's claimed._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:37 PM)_

_`Ibraxas`: Ibraxas looks about Jim, raising an eyebrow._

> `Ibraxas`: You're acting strange, Jim.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:37 PM)_

> I'm gonna stay a while, have a drink with Mora...

_Seth gets up and heads out the ship._

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:37 PM)_

> Not stranger than a guy who poped out of no-where.

_Jim winks at Ibraxas._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:38 PM)_

t!choose 4 bedrooms | 5 bedrooms | 6 bedrooms | 7 bedrooms | 8 bedrooms

**Tatsumaki** _(29-Jun-18 07:38 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | Zander, I pick 5 bedrooms!

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:38 PM)_

> Five bedrooms from what I know of.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:38 PM)_

`Ibraxas`: @Magic8ball Does Ibraxas explore the new ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Lowercase yes, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:38 PM)_

@Magic8ball Is the bomb a dud and does Jim turn into a little baby?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | N0, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:39 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the bomb detonate and destroy the old ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:39 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Likely no, TheBlade.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:39 PM)_

> Anyways, let's stay for a bit and have a few drinks.
> In celebration of the new ship.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:39 PM)_

> You sure you don't want to look at the ship?

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:39 PM)_

> Nah.
> I could care less about what the ship looks like.
> As long as it's vintage, I don't care.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:40 PM)_

_Jim sighs._

> You havent even seen its functions....

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:40 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does Emmett hop onto the largest bed?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:40 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | N0, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:40 PM)_

_Seth shrugs as Mora pours him a drink._

> Emmett does so it's fine.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:40 PM)_

> Hm.

_Emmett continues to look around the ship._

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:41 PM)_

> Hey Ibraxas, I see you got a metal arm, mind a little match?

_Jim puts up his hand for arm wrestling, propping his elbow on a counter._

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:42 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: Sure.

_`Ibraxas`: Ibraxas imitates Jim, grabbing his hand._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:42 PM)_

t!choose Medic's chamber | Engine room | Lounge | Cockpit | Meeting room | Kitchen

**Tatsumaki** _(29-Jun-18 07:42 PM)_

t!roll d20

**Tatsumaki** _(29-Jun-18 07:42 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20... Rolled a 13, TheBlade.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:42 PM)_

`Ibraxas`: t!roll d20

**Tatsumaki** _(29-Jun-18 07:42 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20... Rolled a 15, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:43 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: It looks like I won.

_`Ibraxas`: Ibraxas smiles victoriously._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:43 PM)_

_Emmett rubs a hoof on the exterior of the engine in awe._

> This looks mighty powerful.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:43 PM)_

_Jim taps Ibraxas's shoulder._

> Good arm you got there.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:43 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: Thanks.

`Ibraxas`: @Magic8ball Does Ibraxas Find a suitable room to sleep in?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:44 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Y35, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:44 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the bomb teleport onto Jim?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:44 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yeah, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:45 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: I'm dropping my stuff off in this room.

_Ibraxas drops whatever Bail packed from the old ship into the cabin he's claimed._

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:45 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the bomb Teleport back and explode onto the old ship?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:45 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | NO, TheBlade.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:45 PM)_

_Emmett heads over to the cabin Ibraxas is in._

> So, new guy.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:45 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: Yeah?

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:46 PM)_

> What's your name?

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:46 PM)_

_Jim jumps from the sudden bomb in his lap._

> WHY IS THERE A BOMB IN MY LAP?!?!

_Jim grabs it and runs around in circles in panic._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:46 PM)_

> Who knows.

_Seth takes a sip of some booze._

> None of us use explosives.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:46 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: Ibraxas. I mean, I remember all of Serpile and Bail's memories.
> `Ibraxas`: So i'm not technically new.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:47 PM)_

> Alright. I'll just call you Serpail.

_Emmett nudges Ibraxas playfully._

> As that's plenty easier.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:47 PM)_

_Ibraxas frowns._

> `Ibraxas`: Please don't.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:47 PM)_

_Jim sets the bomb on the floor._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:47 PM)_

_Emmett looks into the room curiously._

> So Bailpile. You're taking this room?

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:48 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: Yeah, I guess. It's a nice room.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:48 PM)_

> Well Emmett, I dont actualy think he is mutiple people, maybe multiple personalities, but i believe he is one being capable of changing his form.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:48 PM)_

_Emmett ignores Jim, more focused on room assignment._

> Cool. Need to keep track of the rooms being taken. Jim, are you claiming a room?

@Magic8ball Does Emmett rest atop of one of the unclaimed rooms?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:49 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Wait to ask this again, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:49 PM)_

> I'll take the one bed bedroom, with the window view and personal kitchen and bathroom of course.

_Jim crosses his arms in a self-righteous way._

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:50 PM)_

> There's no room like that, but okay.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:50 PM)_

> This place is like a mini-motel...
> Wait, then why is there a toilet in the closet then?

_Jim flushes the toilet._

> I thought it was a bathroom.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:51 PM)_

`Ibraxas`: @Magic8ball Does Ibraxas start to polish his sniper while sitting on his bed?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:51 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:51 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does our new ship get abducted by space pirates along with the crew?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:51 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Wait to ask this again, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:51 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the old ship start catching fire?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:51 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, TheBlade.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:52 PM)_

`Ibraxas`: @Magic8ball Does Ibraxas stare at his rifle, contemplating his new existence?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:52 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does our new ship get abducted by space pirates along with the crew?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:52 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: I don't even know who I am anymore...

_Ibraxas holds Bail's sniper rifle, staring at it solemnly._

> `Ibraxas`: Should I even use this rifle?

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:53 PM)_

@Magic8ball Does the ship get sucked into a vortex created by another ship teleporting into view?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:53 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, TheBlade.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:53 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: I'm no longer a novakid, so am I even part of my family anymore?
> `Ibraxas`: Am I more argonian, or more novakid?`

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:54 PM)_

> Great time to question your existence.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:54 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: I wish i had some answers.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:54 PM)_

_Emmett whispers around the corner in jest._

> Eat yourself to get your answers...

@Magic8ball Does Emmett start to doze off?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:55 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Resounding no, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:55 PM)_

> Hey Ibraxas are you okay?

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:55 PM)_

_Emmett speaks loudly to make it seemm like he was in a room._

> This sure is comfy.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:55 PM)_

_`Ibraxas`: Ibraxas rolls his eyes._

> `Ibraxas`: I know that's you on the comms, Emmett.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:55 PM)_

> Looking a bit loopy.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:55 PM)_

> What about me?

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:56 PM)_

`Ibraxas`: @Magic8ball Does Ibraxas fall asleep on his new bed?

**Magic8Ball** _(29-Jun-18 07:56 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nay, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(29-Jun-18 07:56 PM)_

> `Ibraxas`: I guess i'm staying up tonight.

_`Ibraxas`: Ibraxas adjusts his seating on his bed._

**Bagelwrecker** _(29-Jun-18 07:57 PM)_

> Anyways Emmett, remember Space Rule 120: Don't forget to not die.

**Zander** _(29-Jun-18 07:58 PM)_

> Alright, man. Good night to you too.

**TheBlade** _(29-Jun-18 07:58 PM)_

> Unless you're Ibraxas apparently.

_Jim chuckles to himself._
