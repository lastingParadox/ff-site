t!8ball Does Emmett wake up from his new room on the new ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 02:41 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Concentrate and ask again, Zander.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 02:41 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett wake up from his new room on the new ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 02:41 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, Zander.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 02:42 PM)_

> Ah! Good morning.

_Emmett peers around the hallway._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 02:43 PM)_

_Sanya leans in the hall and gives Emmett a slight wave._

> Hello, Emmett.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 02:43 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector wake up in his new room?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 02:43 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, MultiTheDuck.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

_Emmett is taken aback by Sanya's appearance and shakes his head quickly._

> You scared me, Sanya.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

> Not my fault.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

> Get any sleep?

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

_Sanya stretches._

> Wassn't tired.

t!8ball Does Sanya go and wake up the rest of the crew?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

_Sanya turns to her room to wake up Iris._

> I'll go wake everyone up.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

_Matieu swings into the hall in a daze._

> Ugh... plantwoman....

t!8ball Does the half asleep Matieu lick one of Sanya's flowers?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Cannot predict now, Enchantingtable2013.

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

_Seth speaks into his comms watch from his room, sounding a bit frustrated._

> Where is my hologram projector?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

_Emmett sighs and replies to Seth._

> We didn't install it yet.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

> Morning, Bird. Morning Sseth.

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

> Shit...

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 02:48 PM)_

_Emmett gives a slight smile to his crewmates filling up the hall._

> Hey everyone.
> Want some breakfast?

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 02:49 PM)_

> Do you have ssteak?

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 02:49 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth get up from bed and go make him a bowl of breakfast salad?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 02:49 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 02:51 PM)_

_Seth sits at counter, picking at his salad with a fork._

> I wish we had stopped by to have dinner with my family.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 02:51 PM)_

_Emmett inhales with a piqued expression._

> Your parents are weird.

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 02:51 PM)_

> Yeah, but that's just how noble and religious elven families are.

_Seth gives Emmett an affectionate head scratch._

> My mother seems to enjoy your company a little too much though.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

> I'm here now, still learning this ship, did I miss anything?

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

> Nothing much, we're just having breakfast.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

> That's good...

_Hector sits at the table opposing Seth and Emmett._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

> She overfed me that one time. Quite strange.

t!8ball Does Emmett take out some raw meat from the fridge?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

> Tsk. Just like your grandmother did when I escorted you to her home.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

_Sanya takes in the wonderful aroma of blood and tissue._

> Ooh. what meat iss that?

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

_Hector eyeballs the meat and pinches his nose, the stench quite pungent._

> Not any form of pork, that's for sure.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

_Emmett mutters darkly. Looking at the meat in disgust._

> Llama.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

> What did you say? I couldn't hear you?

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

> I dont care what it iss.

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

> Your grandmother made a great salad though, guess that's the result of that giant farming operation she owned.

_Seth pops a berry in his mouth._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

_Emmett gulps and speaks louder, regretting his past decision to procure said meat._

> Llamanian.

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

_Seth raises an eyebrow, realizing what Emmett was saying._

> Emmett, you okay?

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

> Oh my, where did you get that from?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

_Emmett stares at the meat cube._

> Know how I was acting strange the other day?

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

> Yeah...?

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

> Yes, why is that?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

> I put down a soldier that day and felt guilty...

_Emmett shivers and starts digging in the cabinets._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector look through the cabinets for something other than llama to eat?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, MultiTheDuck.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 02:59 PM)_

> So you cut them up and put them in the fridge?

_Hector gulps, having nearly puked._

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 02:59 PM)_

_Seth sighs and rolls his eyes, believing Emmett was overreacting._

> Welp, whatever.
> Who cares?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

> I didn't chop them up. I took them to a butcher...

_Emmett looks around at the others, doubting himself._

> I dunno'. I feel bad for it...

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya eat the llama meat?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Brakia.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

> Didn't want to let him go to waste...

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

_Hector inhales deeply and tries to be reassuring despite his disgust._

> Thats a good idea, like the Native Martians and the Larates...

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

> I've never tried Llama.

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

> Might as well, right my little murderer?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

_Emmett scowls at Seth, flaring his canines._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

> It's not bad, really depends where it is from and how it is cooked...

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

_Emmett takes out a skillet and tosses the cut meat upon it._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

> That's a good start, never broil llama.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

> Here goes nothing, I guess.

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth put his bowl away?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett cook the meat well-done?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Zander.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

_Sanya taps her feet from the wondrous aroma of the cooking meat._

> Sso, what are we doing today?

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

_Seth scoffs out of disgust._

> Yum...

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

_Emmett takes out a spatula and crushes the meat._

> Honestly, probably skinny dipping. Jackshit.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

> Supply run maybe?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Emmett shrugs._

> I dunno'.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya's god appear to her and give her a quest?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, MultiTheDuck.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

_Sanya rolls her eyes at Emmett's immature gesture._

> I heard about thiss group of wandering knightss that were around thiss ssysstem.

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

_Seth bangs his fist against the table._

> Lets kill them!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

> My thoughtss exactly.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

_Emmett grimaces._

> Morbid.
> No.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

> Or we could go a day without killing someone?

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

> Emmett we need to go to a space station!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

_Emmett groans and turns off the stove. The smell of the cooked llamanian meat was less pungent than before, but still unappealing._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:18 PM)_

t!8ball Do the knights start to attack the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Brakia.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

> What was that?!!

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

t!8ball Do they go away?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

_Emmett immediately grabs onto the stove from the sudden rustling of the ship from the ambush._

> It's a hit and run!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

> Follow them!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

> Should we chase them?

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

_Seth stands up and groans loudly._

> No!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew start chasing them?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, Zander.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:20 PM)_

> I'll be back in a second, I'm going to get my rifle!

t!8ball Does Hector find a few knights trying to raid the ship on the way to his room?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, MultiTheDuck.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew catch up and board the knight's ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 03:22 PM)_

t!8ball Did every weapon in the system the crew's in get turned into dildos?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Bagelwrecker.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

_Hector picks up his rifle before it appears to transform into a latex sex toy._

> God dammit, what happened to my rifle?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(15-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

_Seth takes out his desert eagle and realizes that the barrel appears to be quite floppy and rubbery._

> Cool!
> I can't wait to beat a few heads in with Sanya's used dildos!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

_Emmett raises an eyebrow as his crossbow's ammunition appears to be replaced with explosive dildos._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

> Iris wakes up suddenly.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

t!8ball Do the weapons exchange into their normal forms with the ability to turn into dildos when wanted?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:27 PM)_

> Wh-?!

_Iris looks around frantically for her dagger._

> Where's my mom's dagger...?

_Iris stands, whipping around to scan the room._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

t!8ball Do the knights start attacking the crew with grass dildos?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, MultiTheDuck.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

_Iris spots the dagger on the nightstand, breathing a sigh of relief and snatching it up._

> Good.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya's flesh sword return to its original form?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Brakia.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

> I have no clue what I'd do if I lost it.

_Iris gives a sly smile._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

> Wait, my ssword changed.

_Sanya rotates the sword haphazardly, looking about the hilt._

> Oh yeah, I forgot.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

_Iris hums, putting her dagger back in its sheath._

> What to do, what to do...

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:31 PM)_

> My ssword wassn't alwayss made of flesh...

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

_An idea strikes Iris, and she smiles lightly, humming a tune as she makes her way to the kitchen._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

_Sanya rubs her fingertips on the sharp end of her blade, muttering to herself._

> The maker of thiss sword curssed it so that when he killed himsself with it, the blade would transsform into a ssword made of hiss flessh.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris make an obscene amount of muffins?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Jelsafan0.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

> Sso he could "live on" or ssomething.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

_Emmett, who was aiming at the knights with his crossbow, gives the two lollygaggers a perturbed look._

> JUST GET ON THE WITH THE KILLING! SQUOAT DAMNIT!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

> I never questioned it...

_Sanya hisses, sheathes her blade, and leaves her room to join in on the carnage._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

_Iris, meanwhile, begins to bake, and the unmistakable scent of blueberry muffins filters into the air._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:36 PM)_

t!8ball Does the lead knight take out his massive dildo-shaped club?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:36 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Zander.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

t!roll d25

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d25... Rolled a 5, WatchfulDrake.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Using his spare blasters, Hector shoots at the knights without much caution. His shoddy aim results in mostly missed shots more than anything._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

t!roll d30

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d30... Rolled a 19, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

_Sanya rushes into the enemy ship and takes out her blade, slicing one of the knight's heads clean off._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

t!roll d15

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d15... Rolled a 3, Zander.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

_`Lead Knight`: The lead knight attempts to slap Sanya with his massive dildo-shaped club, however he manages to miss with it, and he ends up swinging himself to the floor._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

_Iris hums a lullaby her father taught her as she bakes._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

_Emmett is about to shoot his crossbow before he realizes that his weapon would probably cause more collateral damage than anything. He decides to put up his weapon and leave the others, joining Iris in the kitchen._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

t!8ball Has Iris already baked 4 dozen muffins?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett have his translator set to "charismatic" due to it glitching out from a stray blast?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

_Four dozen freshly-baked muffins sit on the counter as she places another dozen into the oven._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

_Emmett sits down at the kitchen table and gives Iris a soft smile._

> Hey, good-looking. Watcha' making?

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

t!roll d25

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d25... Rolled a 9, WatchfulDrake.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

_Hector reloads his weapons and tries to hit at the knights once more. He's able to tag a few of them, however his shots aren't that effective due to the armor the knights are wearing._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

t!roll d30

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d30... Rolled a 29, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

_Sanya takes the Dreadsword and focuses her attention to the fallen lead knight. She manages to critically wound him, having slashed down the length of his exposed back._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

_`Lead Knight`: The lead knight howls in pain as the sword trails along his spine._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

t!roll d15

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d15... Rolled a 5, Zander.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

_`Lead Knight`: The lead knight tries to get up to get back at Sanya, however his pain causes him to revulse to the ground. As he falls back down, he swipes at Sanya's legs, causing her to trip and fall over._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

_Nobody has called Iris good looking in a very, very long time. Iris's cheeks turn ever slightly pink, but she ignores it, smiling lightly._

> Muffins. Though, I think I should make cake or croissants next...
> ...I may have made too many.

_Iris is a tad flustered, considering she has made an obscene amount of muffins already._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

> Oh, that's okay. The more you make, the more we can enjoy your baking talent.

_Emmett pulls at his collar and gives Iris a pained smile._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

_As if on cue, the oven beeps and Iris pulls out the batch of muffins, placing them on top of it. She's still a tad flustered._

> You think so? They... always turn out blueberry. I thought that was a bit weird.

_Iris gets to work on some baguettes._

t!8ball Does Iris somehow make four baguettes at once?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

_Iris places them casually into the oven, turning it on, before starting on croissants._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett get shocked by his translator?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Zander.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

t!roll 25

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d25... Rolled a 9, WatchfulDrake.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_Hector takes a deep breath and once he's able to shoot at the lead knight, he does so. However, as mentioned before, the knights' armor appears to absorb most of his shots, dealing low, yet noticeable damage to the exposed lead knight._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_Emmett slaps his collar around and it emits out a static buzz before he speaks._

> Hey Iris. Want to go out by the pool later?

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

t!roll d30

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d30... Rolled a 16, Brakia.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_Iris gives him a strange look, not understanding his predicament with the translator._

> ... The pool? I'm... not sure I have a swimsuit.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

t!roll d50

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d50... Rolled a 3, Zander.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

_`Lead Knight`: The lead knight, as a last resort, grabs the rug near him. It transforms into an absurdly large dildo bat. Unfortunately, as he's stuck to the ground, he's unable to make the most out of his weapon. He tries to slap the life out of Sanya, however he only is able to slam the sex toy on the ground._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

> He's got to be weak...

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

> That sseemss like it wass ssupossed to be more powerful...

_Sanya kicks away the bat from the lead knight and pins him down with the hilt of her blade._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

> `Lead Knight`: I am dying...

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

> Agreed, let's not let him do that again...

_Hector eyeballs the knight with disgust and keeps his blasters aimed at him._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

> Good.

_Sanya shifts the hilt around the knight's back to inflict as much pain as possible to him._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

> Why did you attack our ship?

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris have a swimsuit?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

> ... Or... maybe I do?

_The oven beeps and Iris pulls out three blueberry baguettes._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

t!8ball Does the knight consume a tonic, increasing his strength and his health?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

> ... There... wasn't supposed to be this many?

_Iris shrugs the kitchen magic off, putting the baguettes to the side and putting in her blueberry croissants._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

> That's not good!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

_Emmett pulls on his collar and it snaps back onto his neck like a high-tension rubber band._

> I mean, swimsuits are uncomfortable, if you get what I mean.

_The collar shocks him once more, causing Emmett to let out a small whimper._

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d25... Rolled a 11, WatchfulDrake.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

_Hector continues to blast into the rejuvenated knight, managing to land a shot in his back._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d30... Rolled a 1, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

_Sanya charges up a powerful swing, enough to turn her whole body around with the rotational force. Unfortunately, she completely misses the knight with her blade, and is close to slicing herself with it!_

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Iris hums, completely missing the fact that Emmett's unintentionally coming onto her._

> I disagree. When I went swimming in the waterfall in the woods near our home, I always thought the swimsuit felt a lot like a second skin.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Thankfully, Sanya misses herself with the swing and manages to swing around once more, aiming her sword at the knight!_

t!roll d30

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d30... Rolled a 18, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Sanya continues the arc of her swing and slams the blade into the lead knight's side! She kicks the knight, dislodging her sword and pants._

> Why wont you die!?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

> `Lead Knight`: DEATH SLAP OF DEATHLY DEATH!

_`Lead Knight`: The lead knight takes off his glove and prepares to slap his two assailants._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:57 PM)_

_Sanya is taken aback by the knight's stupid statement._

> What?

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

_Hector backs up from the knight and holds his hands out to try and lower the battle tension._

> You don't have to die, you and your crew can surrender!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

t!choose Hector | Sanya | Hector | Sanya | Both | Himself | Neither

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 03:59 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d60... Rolled a 20, Zander.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 03:59 PM)_

_`Lead Knight`: The lead knight slaps both Sanya and Hector with such a velocity that it endangers both of their very lives, having activated a hidden rocket within his armor to propel him. He spits out some blood and spurts out more nonsense._

> `Lead Knight`: I GO BYE BYE!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 03:59 PM)_

_Sanya recoils from the slap and instinctively holds a hand to her face._

> Sshit, that wass powerful!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

_The oven beeps, and Iris pulls out her batch of two dozen croissants, placing it to the side, and putting in a batch of the same size._

t!8ball Are there somehow 50 muffins sitting on the counter now?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

_Emmett desperately tries to take his collar off to no avail._

> What's the point of a second skin when-

_Emmett's collar shocks him violently once more._

> You already have one?

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

_Sanya audibly scoffs over Emmett's statement over the comms._

> Emmett, sstop flirting.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

_Iris gives Emmett a slightly disturbed look._

> Modesty was a very prominent value on my home planet.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

_`Lead Knight`: The knight takes a step back and takes a sword to his neck._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:01 PM)_

> Knight stop! you have a good setup here, you don't have to give it all up! Surrender now!

_Hector drops his blaster as a means of passing the olive branch._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

_Emmett tries to take his translator off, but it's affixed to the point that he manages to take his shirt off instead._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu devour half of the muffins and then proceed to also flirt with Iris?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

_Through stuffed cheeks, Matieu beckons to Iris, having swiped half of the muffins while she was staring at Emmett's fluffy chest._

> Aye' babycakes, those muffins were good A.F.!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

_Iris turns red and turns away quickly in embarrassment._

> A-Ah, th-thank you???
> P-please put your shirt back on!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

_Matieu looks down at his shirt, confused at her request._

> What? I'm fine.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

_Emmett attempts to snap off his collar, struggling with it. The frequency of its shocks increases, causing Emmett to howl in pain._

> THIS HURTS LIKE SHI-

_Emmett gulps and tries to compose himself._

> Iris, don't turn around.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

_Hector smacks his face in embarrassment, hearing Matieu over the comms._

> Oh great Matieu is sleep-flirting... You know one time he did that to the ship's fridge...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

_Matieu attempts to put an arm around Iris and stumbles forward, giving Iris a devious smirk._

> It's not like I have bird nipples, but if I show you my chest, you show me yours....

_Matieu clicks his tongue._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:04 PM)_

_Iris turns redder, baking at a much quicker and more furious pace to keep the two firtacious idiots out of her mind._

> P-please don't!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

_Matieu leans on the wall, not understanding Iris's embarrassment._

> What?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

t!8ball Is there a tiny wizard on top of the fridge who causes Emmett's translator to glitch?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_More and more baked goods are being pulled out of the oven at an impressive speed._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

t!8ball Does the knight surrender his ship, crew, supplies and service to the Vortox Pummelers?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, MultiTheDuck.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_Sanya sighs, slightly disappointed over the non-violent outcome, but also relieved._

> That wass sslightly eassier than expected...

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

> I'm glad you came to reason, knight.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

> `Lead Knight`: My name is Todd.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

_Iris, in a panic, finally questions the weird kitchen magic going on, and freaks out a bit, unsure why Emmett and Matieu are hitting on her simultaneously._

> I don't understand what's happening-

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> That'ss nice...

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> Okay Todd, you and your crew can continue your mission, but if we ever need you we will call on you and your crew...

_Hector pats Todd on the back, causing him to yelp and jump a bit from his wounded back._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya look through the new stach of weapons for a new side weapon?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Brakia.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

t!8ball Is there an incredible amount of blueberry baked goods on the counter right now?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

_Emmett is fumbling with his translator fiercely, ignoring the kitchen phenomenon occurring._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_The mountain of blueberry baked goods in the kitchen has reached insane heights; it spans to the ceiling now._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

`Todd`: t!8ball Does Todd accidentally press the airlock button when he's resting?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Zander.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_`Todd`: Todd manages to eject himself out the airlock, having been resting against the airlock door from their encounter._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

_Sanya rolls her eyes and leaves the ship, having had her fill of excitement from the cretin knights. She enters the kitchen, surprised from the sheer amount of confectionary goods._

> Iriss, why iss the kitchen filled with muffinss?!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

> Todd!

_Hector gives a disappointed tongue click and looks to the ground, shaking his head._

> Now I have to choose a new leader for them...

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

> I don't understand what's going on, Sanya, can you please explain to my why this is happening?!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

_Hector points to a random knight that happened to be unharmed from the crew's ambush._

> You there, you seem familiar, what is your name?

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

_Sanya shakes her arms in a frenzy._

> Why would I know!?

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

_Iris's baking has not slowed. She is absolutely frantic._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

> `Edwin`: My name is Edwin, knight from Camelot, I am searching with this crew for my horse!

_`Edwin`: It is clear that Edwin is either delusional or from the wrong time period._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

> IRISS SSTOP!!

_Sanya grabs at Iris's shoulders to try and pry her away from the oven._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

_Emmett whines like a puppy profusely, still fixated on removing his translator._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

_The mountain of goods now spills out into the hall. Iris groans painfully._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

> Okay nice, you have fun with that, you're now the leader of this crew, go find your horse, but you are still under our command!

_Hector waves off the knights and heads back to the Panty Slingshot._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

> SSTOP!!

_Sanya grips into Iris's shoulders, causing her to bleed a bit._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

_Iris huffs and continues baking, not giving Sanya nor her bleeding shoulders any notice._

> Please make him put his shirt back on-

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector spot a small plasma pistol on his way out of the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, MultiTheDuck.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

_Iris's mind is conflicted from Emmett's apparent lack of modesty, and said confliction causes her to continue to bake to get his semi-nude body out of her mind._

> My heart can't take much more of this-

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

_Hector swipes the plasma pistol and leaves the knights' ship._

> I'll be taking that from you, Have fun now!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

> Iriss, pleasse sstop!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Matieu, completely unfazed by Iris's emotions, pats his stomach gluttonously and gives a beaky smile._

> Please, make more muffins!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Hector walks in the kitchen, playing with the plasma pistol._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Matieu giggles._

> I mean they're not as finely made as you, but please make more muffins.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Hector is taken aback from the confectionary goods filling the entire kitchen and drops his plasma pistol in bewilderment._

> Dear god, why are there so many muffins?!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Iris continues to bake, shaking her head._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Emmett sobs as his collar continues to shock him._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> I mean I'm a man of morals.

_Matieu winks in Iris's direction despite that she isn't paying attention to him._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya take Iris out of the kitchen?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

> Come here!

_Sanya is finally able to drag Iris away from the kitchen and takes her into their shared room._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Iris has streams of confused tears going down her face._

> I'm not used to being complimented. I'm not okay-

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Matieu's head pivots, following Iris as she's taken out the kitchen._

> And baking is a very attractive trait.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

> Let'ss calm you down...

_Sanya sits Iris on her bed._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Hector eyeballs the shirtless squoatling who is still having trouble with his collar._

> And why is Emmett being shocked by his translator?

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Iris wipes her eyes, shaking a bit._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Sanya groans loudly and peeks into the hallway, screaming._

> Alsso, Matieu!
> WAKE UP!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Emmett finally declares defeat over his collar. He slumps in his chair gloomily and kicks some muffins aside._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

_Hector takes to Emmett's side, noticing his defeated look._

> Emmett what happened while I was gone? Are you okay?

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

_Sanya shuts their door and sits next to Iris on the bed._

> Are you alright, Iriss?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu wake up?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

_Matieu shakes awake, completely unaware of his inappropriate behavior prior._

> OH SHIT.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Emmett looks up at Hector in a way that indicates shit happened, his mouth quivering._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Sanya exhales and mutters into her comms watch._

> Morning, prince charmer.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

> Hector, what did I say?!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Hector smirks._

> It makes what you said to the fridge look like a Quarterfette card.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Iris sniffles._

> I haven't had a romantic interaction with a boy... ever...

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

_Sanya looks away from Iris, unsure how to respond._

> Oh. I'm not really the one to talk to about that...

_Sanya puts her hand on her neck, uncomfortable._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

> I'm not okayyyyyyyyy...

_Iris leans her face on Sanya's shoulder, balling her eyes out._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

_Emmett sticks his tongue out, getting shocked in the process._

> MY TRANSLAT-

_Emmett convulses from the painful shocks._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> Okay lets take that off for now...

_Hector reaches out to Emmett's collar but takes his hand back when Emmett is shocked once more._

> We don't need you to get zapped anymore...

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Apathetically, Sanya stands up, causing Iris to fall onto the bed._

> I have to check on Emmett. Jusst sstay calm, alright?

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

_Iris remains quiet and shivers on the bed._

t!8ball Does Iris remember how the other children always avoided her because she was half-archidemon?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett try to pull the translator off, despite the additional harm it could cause him?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Zander.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> PLIERS-

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

> Where are they, can you point to where they are?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

_Emmett shakily points in the general direction of the cockpit._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

> I'll be right back.

_Hector gets up and leaves for the cockput. He's a good man._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

_Iris's memory is pushed to her one and only crush, who avoided her because she was a hybrid. Because she was... different._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

_Before Sanya leaves the room, she looks back at the pitiful mess that is Iris._

> Hey Iriss, are you alright?

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

_Iris nods silently, sniffling._

> Fine.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

> Okay, will these work?

_Hector holds up the pliers he found._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

> Alright. If you're ssure...

_Sanya leaves the room and heads back into the kitchen._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

_Emmett nods._

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 1, Zander.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

_Thankfully, removing the collar did little to harm Emmett any more._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

> Did that help?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

_Emmett stretches and rubs his neck. He gives out a bleat of acceptance._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

> Oh no...

_Sanya enters the kitchen, seeing a frazzled and sweating squoatling being attended to by Hector._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

> That's good...

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

_Emmett grabs the collar and starts to rearrange some wires, hoping he could fix the translator. Buying a new one would be quite a pain._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

t!8ball does Hector start working on his flying drone?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:33 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, MultiTheDuck.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya squat down and check on Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

_Sanya heads over to Emmett and tilts her head out of concern for her best friend. She peeks at his chest, unsure why Iris would be so embarrassed over some flat and hairy flesh._

> You alright, Emmett?

_Sanya shivers a bit in repugnance over her previous thoughts._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

_Emmett nods._

> Hel, Ya.

Squoatish Translation: "Yeah, Sanya."

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:36 PM)_

> Okay...

_Sanya raises a leafy eyebrow over Emmett's dialect._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:36 PM)_

> Squo dobre.

Squoatish Translation: "I'm fine."

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:38 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris set her translator to Squoatish so she can talk to him, grabbing a muffin on the way to sit?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Jelsafan0.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:38 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu awake flirt with Iris now?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Enchantingtable2013.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

_Iris takes a big breath, enters the kitchen, and sits next to Emmett, trying not to look at his bare chest. She changes her translator to Squoatish, wanting to have a conversation with him over what just occurred between them._

> Hey.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

_Emmett looks over to the half-elf and gives her a half-smile. He speaks to her perfectly, considering that she's changed her translator source language._

> Hey Iris.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

> You okay?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector start to handstand?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Zander.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

t!choose crab | head | normal | other

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | MultiTheDuck, I pick crab!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

> I think so. I think I might have accidentally flirted with you due to this damned thing.

_Emmett holds his broken collar in his hands awkwardly._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

_Hector does a crab-stand, a Martian stretch that emulates straightening one's body like that of a crustacean's._

> Sorry don't mind me, just stretching, it's unhealthy to not stretch after a fight.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:42 PM)_

_Iris sighs in relief._

> You really startled me there.

_Iris suddenly realizes Emmett is still shirtless. Her face turns incredibly red and she turns her head quickly._

> C-can you put your shirt back on?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:43 PM)_

> I mean, you're pretty cute. Wouldn't mind going to the pool later...

_Emmett looks over to the window, the aerogel pool beckoning him._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:44 PM)_

> But not really my type, to be honest...

_Emmett looks away and shrugs, his face faltering a bit from his obvious bluff._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:44 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya get a shirt for Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:44 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Brakia.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:44 PM)_

_Iris considers Emmett's request for a second._

> ... I haven't gone swimming in forever. Why not?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:45 PM)_

_Matieu follows Emmett's stare and grins._

> We can both get in the pool babycakes, you ever been skinny dipping?

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:46 PM)_

_Sanya rolls her eyes at Matieu's cat call._

> I like the pool. I like the feel of the water.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

_Iris grimaces from Matieu's statement._

> ... He's joking, right?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

_Emmett puts a digit to his chin and looks up at the ceiling._

> Skinny dipping?

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

_Iris's face is very red, her eyes falling to Emmett's chest for a bit before heading back up._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

_Emmett shrugs and looks back to Iris ambivalently._

> I wouldn't mind.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 04:48 PM)_

_Sanya observes Iris's frown._

> Don't worry about him, Iriss.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:48 PM)_

> I'm not joking. It'll be fun!

_Matieu shrugs. Clearly he doesn't have much to hide given that he's an avian._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:48 PM)_

> Pool isn't bad, bad place for stretches though.

_Hector switches exercise stances._

> I'm not going to skinny dip.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:48 PM)_

_Iris is a uncomfortable with the prospect of skinny dipping. Iris scoffs, remembering Matieu's nickname of "babycakes" he called her._

> Does he know I'm of drinking age?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes and chuckles._

> Just relax Iris. Let me get this thing fixed up first.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:51 PM)_

> Alright...

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:51 PM)_

_Emmett continues to tinker with his collar._

> It's not perverted, I think.

_The cultural differences between Squoatlings and half-elf demon hybrids are immense._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:52 PM)_

_Iris is put off by Emmett's statement._

> What isn't?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:52 PM)_

_Matieu gives Emmett a tiny wave._

> Hey Iris, tell Emmett I say, "hi"!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:52 PM)_

_Iris sighs and switches her translator for a second._

> ... You know he can understand you, right?

_She then switches it back to Squoatish._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:52 PM)_

> Oh...

_Matieu smacks his beak._

> Oops.
> Well, hi Emmett!
> We'll get your stuff fixed soon buddy.

_Matieu smiles beakily._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:54 PM)_

_Emmett waves, scratching his chest as he continues to fix up his collar._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:55 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris find a shirt for Emmett yet?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:55 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Better not tell you now, Jelsafan0.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:55 PM)_

_Hector raises up the lower half of his body and back legs, curling them around, shaping himself to be similar to a scorpion._

> You really are missing out, there's nothing like scorpion walk stretches

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:56 PM)_

_The collar emits some sparks as Emmett wraps up work on his translator._

> What's a scorpion?

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:56 PM)_

_Hector tilts his head._

> What did he say?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:56 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett get his translator fixed?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:56 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:56 PM)_

_Iris hums in thought._

> It's like a crab with a stinger on its tail... I think.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:56 PM)_

_Emmett holds the collar up to his neck and turns it on. He clears his throat, switching the target language back to GU Binary._

> Ahem. Wha-what's a scorpion?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu talk nicely to Iris whilst Hector is nearby?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:57 PM)_

> I honestly think that you'd enjoy it, Iris...

_Matieu nears Iris, holding out a feathery wing to lift her up from her chair._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:58 PM)_

> Oh, nice you got it working! Scorpions are a terran bug that look a bit like how I do currently!

_Hector flexes his legs. Weird._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:58 PM)_

_Iris switches her translator back to GU Binary and takes Matieu's hand, standing up._

> ... You think so?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:58 PM)_

> Yes. I tried it, it's fun.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:58 PM)_

_Emmett raises an eyebrow, observing Hector's physique._

> Scorpions look scary.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

_Iris rubs her arm, still uncomfortable with the idea of getting naked in a pool with others._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

_Emmett shifts his attention to Iris, confused over her issues with skinny dipping. Seth and most of Squoatopia never seemed to mind._

> And also, we're all adults here, aren't we?

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

> Some are harmless, and they actually taste pretty good...

_Hector unravels his legs._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

_Iris keeps to herself, still unsure._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 04:59 PM)_

> What's the awkward pause for?
> We're all friends here.

_Matieu jabs Iris with his wing playfully._

> Some of us more than friends...

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

> I just... I was always taught not to show too much skin...

_Iris frowns._

> Much less all of it.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

> Why? You're a demon? I don't really care.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

> What?

_Iris gives Matieu a mortified look._

> That... isn't why.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:00 PM)_

_Matieu breathes in, realizing he's taking his desires a bit too far._

> Um, ignore that...
> The point is it's okay to be naked.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:01 PM)_

> My light elf culture just... taught me not to show a lot of skin.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:01 PM)_

> You're an adult, it's okay to have fun.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:01 PM)_

> ... I don't know...

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:01 PM)_

_Sanya glares at Matieu, clenching her fists._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:01 PM)_

_Matieu sighs._

> The light elf culture can also be very strict and unfun.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:01 PM)_

_Iris gasps from Matieu's ignorance._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:01 PM)_

> Live on the wild side, or at least try it.
> If you don't like living outside of the rules after then, okay.

_Matieu shrugs._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

_Sanya scoffs._

> Matieu, would you care to talk?

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

_Hector is disgusted by Matieu's behavior._

> While I do agree it's important to have fun, I think you're asking a bit too much from her currently.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

_Sanya walks up to Matieu._

> ALONE?

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

_Iris is speechless from Matieu's insolence._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

> You're interrupting our conversation.

_Matieu pushes Sanya away._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

_Emmett leans away from Sanya and Matieu, snickering at the situation the avian's put himself in._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:02 PM)_

_Matieu rolls his eyes and mutters._

> I may later. Now shoo.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:03 PM)_

_Sanya grabs Matieu by the collar of his shirt._

> NOW?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:03 PM)_

> Hey! chill!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:03 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett toss his shirt over his shoulder and stand up?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:03 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

_Iris looks back to Emmett, her gaze back on his body. She starts to redden a bit once more._

> ... What are you doing?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

> C'mon, violence isn't the only answer! Give me a bit!

_Matieu grasps at his collar to release himself from Sanya's grip._

> I just want to finish my conversation, is that too much to ask?!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

> I don't know what you guys are doing, but I'm going to the pool.

_Emmett turns to the door leading to the aerodome containing the pool._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:04 PM)_

> I think we sshould talk. Like friendss do, right, BUDDY?

_Sanya lifts Matieu up by his collar, her face mere inches from his._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

_Iris stands, brushing herself off._

> Let me grab my towel and swimsuit, I'll come with.

_Iris leaves for her room and quickly comes back with a black and red hellfire towel and a burgundy swimsuit with black roses around the trims. Thoughtfully, she also came back with some leafy green swim trunks for Emmett._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

_Matieu gives Sanya a sly smile._

> Not with that attitude.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

> I'm going to work on my drone, it's well out of date currently. You two have fun. I may join you later.

_Hector shakes his head and leaves, not wanting to get involved with this developing love square._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

> You'll have to calm down first.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

_Emmett holds out his hoof for Iris._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:05 PM)_

_Iris takes Emmett's cloven hoof, squeezing it softly._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

> I'll join you two later. I have to talk with Matieu...

_Sanya starts to head into her room with Matieu in tow, licking her lips._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

> Oh, hell no!

_Matieu shakes wildly, trying to release himself from his captor._

> Get me the hell outta' here!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

> Why are you scared of me?
> Aren't we... friends?

_Sanya flares her sharp teeth._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

t!8ball Does the wiry Matieu slip out of Sanya's grasp and run for the hills?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

_Wide-eyed, Matieu manages to wring himself out of his shirt, and thus, out of Sanya's grasp. He races to the pool to get within sight of the others._

> FUCK THIS SHIT!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:06 PM)_

_Sanya snickers._

> Bye Mat.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya chase after him?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Better not tell you now, MultiTheDuck.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

> I'm gonna head to the pool.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya chase after him?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, MultiTheDuck.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

_Matieu flips off Sanya through a window._

> FUCK OFF, LEAVE ME THE HALLAL ALONE!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

_Emmett takes Iris to the pool area. He looks up at the void and beams, stars twinkling back at him._

> A perfect view under the starry sky.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:07 PM)_

_Sanya opens up the door to the pool area and looks around for Matieu._

> What's wrong Mat?
> You scared?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:08 PM)_

_Matieu hides around a corner from Sanya._

> Yes, quite honestly!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:08 PM)_

_Iris smiles lightly, staring up at the void._

> It's so pretty.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:08 PM)_

_Hector sighs and turns off his comms, not interested in listening to Emmett and Iris's lovey-doveyness._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:08 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya start emitting an aura of dread as she follows Matieu?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:08 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Brakia.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

_Matieu shapes an "L" to his forehead, taunting Sanya as he runs away from her._

> NAH NAH NAH! FUCK YOU! FUCKA YOUUUU!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

_Emmett dips his back hooves in the pool._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

_Sanya darkly stomps towards Matieu, a wicked smile growing on her face._

> Oh MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

> FUCK OFF CUNT!

_Matieu thrusts out his hips and gestured to his crotch._

> SUCKA ON MY PEEPEE!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

> Now, if it makes you uncomfortable, I won't dip nude...

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

> I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS, MAT!

_Sanya takes out her sword and drags it across the ground._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

> I respect that.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:09 PM)_

_Iris sits on the side of the pool, allowing her feet to also dip into the pool. She gives Emmett a polite smile._

> Thank you. I appreciate it.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:10 PM)_

> CAN'T WE HAVE A CHAT?
> AS FRIENDS?

_Uncontrollably, Sanya bangs her weapon around haphazardly._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:10 PM)_

> NOT IN THIS STATE, CALM YOUR ASS DOWN!

_Matieu cowers, attempting to hide from Sanya._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

> WHAT'S WRONG, MAT?!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

_She sifts her feet through the water peacefully, quietly humming her father's lullaby._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

_Emmett casually slips off his sweatpants and puts them aside. He slips on his swim trunks afterwards. Yes, he does not change out of his boxers out of respect for Iris. Don't question it._

> I'm not getting these wet though.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

> You need to calm down, that's what's wrong!
> I know where you sleep!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:11 PM)_

_Sanya's neck cracks as she trudges toward Matieu, her blade leaving a trail of black sludge on the ground._

> I KNOW WHAT AVIAN TASTES LIKE!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:12 PM)_

_Matieu pops out, sticks his tongue out at Sanya, and bolts off._

> HAHAHAH! EAT MY ASS, YOU WON'T EAT ME!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:12 PM)_

_Iris nods, pulling off her dress to reveal her swimsuit. It just so happens that she changed without anyone knowing. Strange._

> Good idea.

t!8ball Are Iris's eyes glowing faintly?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:12 PM)_

_Emmett just slips in the confines of the pool, then and there._

> It's pretty warm here.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:13 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu jump into the pool in five seconds flat?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Enchantingtable2013.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:13 PM)_

_Iris peers down at the pool curiously._

> Is it?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:13 PM)_

> HELP MY ASS!

_Matieu cannonballs into the pool in an attempt to escape Sanya._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:14 PM)_

_Iris is startled as the peace is interrupted, slipping into the deep end of the pool accidentally with a yelp._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:14 PM)_

_Sanya turns her head to Emmett and Iris and gives them an eerie wave._

> Hi you two, how are you? I'll join you two later.

_Sanya immediately runs to where Matieu dipped into the pool._

> GET BACK HERE BIRD!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:14 PM)_

_Matieu tries to make as much distance between himself and Sanya as possible._

> OH HELL NO! JOIN THEM NOW MOTHERFUCKER!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:15 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 6, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:16 PM)_

_Iris, startled from the sudden cannonball, slips into the aeroslime and struggles to get out, its texture and depth like that of water._

> Ack!

_She manages to cling to the side of the pool, coughing up a mixture of aeroslime and saliva._

> Th-that was unexpected!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett dive under the surface and playfully grab Iris's leg?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:16 PM)_

> Eep!

_Iris yelps, before laughing, still gripping the side. She splashes him._

> Hey!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

t!roll d2

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d2... Rolled a 2, Zander.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:19 PM)_

_Emmett bobs his head above the water and spews out some aeroslime at her._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:20 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector emerge from his room in his gas mask yelling in Martian as gas spills out after him?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, MultiTheDuck.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:20 PM)_

_Iris laughs loudly, creating fire under the water. The fire doesn't fully form, instead creating heat, making the fluid in Emmett's direction feel like the hot tub._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya catch Matieu?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Concentrate and ask again, Brakia.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:22 PM)_

_Emmett gives Iris a smirk and relaxes, closing his eyes. He shrugs off any provocative feelings and drifts next to her._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

_The blue gas Hector has created is visible at the door now. Provided it mixes with the aeroslime, it will produce a potent sleeping gas!_

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

> I don't really care about what's happening in there.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu dart for the pool and do a leaping jump into it, making a smack on the gelatin that can be heard for hundreds of miles?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Enchantingtable2013.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

_Iris settles down, ignoring the chaos around her and deciding to just enjoy herself._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:23 PM)_

_After having gotten out of the pool to continue getting away from Sanya, Matieu decides to dart for the pool once more, jumping high enough to fall completely flat atop the aeroslime before sinking in._

> HOLY MOTHER OF AVOS!
> THAT HURTS LIKE A DAMN VESPOID!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

> MAAAAAAAAAAAAT!

_Sanya taps the blade across the surface of the pool to try and strike Matieu._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

_Iris jumps, breaking her concentration. The heat fades._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:24 PM)_

_Matieu starts to pant intermittently, starting to run out of energy from escaping his captor._

> Fuck off, I can outrun you... if... I... want to...

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

> That's a lie. You have to run out of energy eventually.

_Sanya lets out a devlilish chuckle._

> And me?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

> So will you bitchass.

_Matieu, as if on cue, smears his wing into his pants and flicks a slurry in Sanya's direction._

> SUCK A DICKKKKKKK!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

_Sanya scoffs at Matieu's vile display._

> I am using Him.
> I need nothing.
> But will.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:25 PM)_

> Oh fucking hell.
> GUYS, THE HUNTER IS BACK!

_Matieu flails about in the pool, helpless._

> TIME TO BEAT THEIR ASS!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

_Emmett slowly sinks into the pool, trying to ignore Matieu and Sanya._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

> I am in full control.
> I'm only here for you.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:26 PM)_

> How come, huh?!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:27 PM)_

_Iris stresses out as she runs her fingers through her hair, worry pulling at her face._

> I am incredibly weak right now!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:27 PM)_

> Okay, now is not the time to make more muffins, okay!

_Matieu freaks out and splashes Iris repeatedly._

> Get out of the gelatin, Iris!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:27 PM)_

> Don't worry Iris. I won't hurt you...

_Sanya flares her fangs._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:28 PM)_

_Emmett pulls Iris down, hugging her waist. Breathing in the aeroslime is gross, but it's rich enough in oxygen to dispell any concerns of drowning._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:28 PM)_

_Iris becomes even more stressed at Matieu's remark, sinking further into the water with her eyes squeezed shut._

_She thinks, "Can I not have even one moment of peace?"_

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:29 PM)_

> I wouldn't hurt either of you...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:29 PM)_

> You need to go away Sanya, or else I will either kill you or outrun you for the rest of your existence!

_Matieu cowers in the corner of the pool, realizing he's not going to get any help from Emmett and Iris._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:29 PM)_

_Iris allows herself to sink._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:30 PM)_

t!8ball Does hector start working on a way to pull all the gas back into the drone?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:30 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, MultiTheDuck.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:31 PM)_

_The effects of dread now getting to him, Emmett tries to comfort Iris, hugging her tightly beneath the slime._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:32 PM)_

_Iris hugs back, squeezing her eyes closed in an attempt to shut out the world._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:33 PM)_

_Sanya then proceeds to seize up, as she starts screaming, her jaw dislocating._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:33 PM)_

_Matieu tries his best to shake the two lovebirds out of their trance, however Emmett kicks Matieu square in the chest, leaving a nasty bruise._

> HEY MOTHERFUCKERS-
> FUCK! WAKE UP!

_Matieu wheezes and holds his chest, looking back to whatever Sanya was becoming._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

_Iris clamps her hands over her ears._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

_Matieu starts to have a whiney tone, growing desperate._

> GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE!
> SHE'S SEIZING!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

> `Dread`: Hello.
> `Dread`: It's me again.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

> FUCK OFF, YA' CUNT!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread attempts to ignore Matieu._

> `Dread`: How are you all?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:34 PM)_

> FUCK OFF TWAT!

_Matieu looks around for something to attack Dread with, considering that he's completely cornered._

> SUCKA MY DICKA!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:35 PM)_

> `Dread`: Annoying as always...

_`Dread`: Dread uses Sanya's body to slam her sword down next to Matieu, slicing off some of his feathers as he manages to dodge out of the way._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:35 PM)_

> WHAT'D YOU EXPECT, BRUV?!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:36 PM)_

t!8ball Does The God send out a wave of pure dread?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:36 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Brakia.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:36 PM)_

_Iris closes up, curling into a ball beneath the gel. She thinks, "Why is it always me? Why?"_

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:36 PM)_

_Matieu gets out of the pool and smashes a chair, taking its debris for use as makeshift weapons._

> Idgaf. I'm the most pompous little shit you'll ever see!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:37 PM)_

_Emmett breathes in and puts his hooves on Iris's cheeks to try and divert her attention from her struggles._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:37 PM)_

_Iris opens her eyes, tears in them. She stares into Emmett's mustard gaze, trying her best to calm down._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:38 PM)_

> `Dread`: I hope you all had fun with your little adventures.

_`Dread`: Dread darts to Matieu and slashes at him, swiftly breaking his PVC polearm._

> `Dread`: They were most likely your last.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:38 PM)_

_Frustrated, Matieu jumps back from Dread._

> CAN YOU DICKHEADS GET YOUR ASS OUT OF THE GELATIN!?!
> GET YOU ASS OFF YOUR SHOULDERS OR ELSE THIS THING WILL KILL YOU!

_Matieu continues to hop away from Dread, grabbing whatever he can to defend himself from the floran._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:39 PM)_

> `Dread`: Who's to say that you won't be the only one who dies, Matieu?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:39 PM)_

_Emmett exhales and dips his head above the gelatin, clearly perturbed._

> Hey bipolar plant!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:39 PM)_

> Yknow, the fact that you can suck my dick!

_Matieu grabs another bit of piping and manages to land a hit on the floran, causing Dread to stagger back a bit._

> HAHAH! TWAT!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:39 PM)_

_Emmett flips off the floran._

> Fuck off!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:40 PM)_

> GO FUCK YOURSELF, CUNT!

_Matieu goes in for another swipe, yet manages to accidentally throw his pipe across the pool._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:40 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread snickers and grabs Matieu's face, pushing him away with tremendous force. They turn their attention to Emmett, who is still flipping them off._

> `Dread`: Hello, Tawfeek.
> `Dread`: So nice to see you.

_`Dread`: Dread gives a sarcastic little heart gesture with Sanya's hands._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:41 PM)_

_Iris sinks further under the gel, curling up as she lays on the bottom._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:41 PM)_

> `Dread`: I always like seeing squoatlings...

_Dread flares their fangs and grins._

> `Dread`: It means that the llamanians will still hunt you.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:41 PM)_

_Emmett coughs, the slimy feeling in his lungs not the best for his confidence._

> Get out of Squan's--I mean, my friend's body!

_Emmett cringes as he let his personal nickname for Sanya slip out._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:41 PM)_

> Don't talk to my friend like that, motherfucker!

_Matieu gets up from the ground and lunges at Dread, only to be pushed back like before._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:41 PM)_

> `Dread`: Squan? how silly.

_`Dread`: Dread scoffs._

> `Dread`: I made florans in my image!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:41 PM)_

_Matieu gets up once more, determined to end the floran._

> I'll fucking wipe out the entire Floran race if I have to!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:41 PM)_

_Emmett gives Dread a big thumbs down._

> And the llamanians are cowardly pieces of shit, floran!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:42 PM)_

_Wallowing from Dread's presence, Iris races through her mind, thinking, "Why does this happen? Why me?!"_

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:42 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread snarls at Emmett, as if he called Sanya something heretical._

> `Dread`: Florans don't feel emotions such as familial love.

_`Dread`: Dread begins to float off the ground, contorting._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:42 PM)_

_Iris continues to wallow, holding her knees close to her face. "What did I do to deserve this? I lost everything. I lost... everyone."_

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:42 PM)_

> That's a goddamn lie and you know it, TWAT!

_Matieu attempts to throw more chair debris at the floran to no avail._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:43 PM)_

_Iris' eyes slowly open. Her gaze drifts above._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:43 PM)_

_Hector peers out to check on what's going on and sees Sanya floating and seizing. He digs in his chest, trying to find something that could ease the situation._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:43 PM)_

_Matieu notices Hector's face appear from the curtains above. He frowns and yells into his comms watch._

> HECTOR WHAT THE FUCK!?
> WHERE THE HELL WERE YOUR COMMS WHEN I NEEDED YOU?!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:44 PM)_

> `Dread`: You know Matieu, You are starting to annoy me a little too much...

_`Dread`: Dread floats over to Matieu, preparing their blade. They lick their lips, ready to feast upon the avian's fear of mortality._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:44 PM)_

> Hahah, cunt.

_Matieu spits out some blood and flips off the floran, unfazed._

> Eat a piping hot dick and cry to your god friends!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:44 PM)_

_Hector continues to dig in his chest and starts yelling in Martian. Unfortunately, his yells are muffled by the glass._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:44 PM)_

\*Dreadfully, Iris continues to pity herself. "I lost Bridgette... I lost Calypso... Mom.... dad.... aunt.... uncle...."

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:45 PM)_

_Emmett climbs out of the pool, having had enough of the floran's antics._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:45 PM)_

_`Dread`: The god then takes Sanya's Silversteel sword and infuses it with dread._

> I'm done with you!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:45 PM)_

_Iris's drifting gaze lands on Sanya. "I'm.... alone."_

t!8ball Does Iris have an epiphany?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:46 PM)_

_Iris's gaze wanders to Emmett, out of the water. She smiles softly as she gets an epiphany._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:47 PM)_

> Don't you dare hurt that bird.

_Stupidly, Emmett nears Dread, holding out his arm to grab Sanya's._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:47 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu head back to the pool and run insanely fast circles on the gelatin?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:47 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Enchantingtable2013.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:47 PM)_

_It takes a moment, for Iris to finish processing. For the world to stop moving in slow motion._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:48 PM)_

> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW FAST I AM?

_Matieu scrambles to get up and runs away from Dread, having had an opportunity to catch his breath once more._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:48 PM)_

_Iris swims up with a sudden burst of speed, climbing out of the gelatin. "No." She grits her teeth at the sight of the floran._

> Hello.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:49 PM)_

> `Dread`: Why hello, Iris.

_`Dread`: Dread tilts their head, slightly curious over Iris's appearance._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:49 PM)_

_In a safe distance from Dread, Matieu rolls his eyes and sassily puts his wing on his hip._

> Wow, nice conversation starter.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:49 PM)_

_Iris makes her way to her dress and keeps her eyes on Dread as she pulls out her dagger._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:49 PM)_

> This is like Dantz Dantz Recursion but with conversations!

_Matieu mimics stepping on a dance pad._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:49 PM)_

> You know who I am...

_Iris flares her dagger._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:49 PM)_

_Matieu, still being annoying as ever, begins to chant._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:49 PM)_

> `Dread`: You have quite a reputation in hell, Iris.
> `Dread`: Everyone knows who you are.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:49 PM)_

_Iris exhales sharply._

> You know who I was.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:50 PM)_

> Was?
> What?

_Matieu flails his wings about, trying to get the others' attention._

> I AM COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT TO YOU!
> DID YOU LIE TO ME?!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:50 PM)_

> `Dread`: Tsk. Silence.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:51 PM)_

> You knew my father...

_Iris snaps her fingers, flickering embers emitting with each snap._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:51 PM)_

> Hell naw, dick god.
> Fuck your shit!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:51 PM)_

> `Dread`: The best general iI've known.

_`Dread`: Dread has a sullen expression, trying to get under Iris's skin._

> `Dread`: He misses you, you know.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:52 PM)_

> And I miss him...

_However, Iris is stalwart._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:52 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread grimaces._

> I know.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:52 PM)_

> You get em', girl!

_Like a cheerleader, Matieu waves random shit in the air and jumps for Iris._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:52 PM)_

_`Dread`: A sharp grin returns to Dread's face._

> I know that you miss your mother, too.
> And your aunt.
> And your cousin.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:52 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett just leave the scenario, considering that Dread doesn't really give a shit about him?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Zander.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:53 PM)_

_Having nearly grabbed Sanya's hand, Emmett pulls back, unable to bring himself to do so from the dread dripping off of the floran. She might be far too gone this time._

> Fuck...

_Emmett frowns and starts to think about his fallen plant crush, examining his hoof._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:53 PM)_

> You're right. I do.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:53 PM)_

> `Dread`: Well, I know a way for you to see them again.

_`Dread`: Dread laughs evily._

> `Dread`: All you have to do...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:53 PM)_

> DON'T DO IT IRIS!

_Matieu wags a finger._

> DON'T LISTEN TO THAT CUNT!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:53 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread gives a low growl, and whispers._

> Is surrender to the Dread...

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:54 PM)_

> I won't let you kill me, though.

_Iris furrows her eyebrows, ready to do anything for her friends._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:54 PM)_

> DON'T YOU DO IT!
> DON'T LET THAT TWAT CONTROL YOU!

_Matieu shakes his bird ass at Dread._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:54 PM)_

> You know, I lost everything that day.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:55 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector get all the gas back into the canister using the drone?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:55 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, MultiTheDuck.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:55 PM)_

> And as I watched my cousin turn back to the planet, I will never forget the feeling.
> It was incredible, all-encompassing dread.

_Iris clenches her teeth, readying herself to strike._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:56 PM)_

t!8ball Does Dread teleport Matieu and Emmett away from the battle?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 05:56 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 05:56 PM)_

> `Dread`: Let us settle this in peace.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:56 PM)_

> Well, god damn.

_Matieu and Emmett are teleported to a balcony hanging over the pool._

> Looks like this is a spectator sport, Emmett.
> Oh and what were you doing with Iris earlier?

_Matieu eyeballs Emmett, raising a feathery eyebrow._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:57 PM)_

> But, you know what?

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:58 PM)_

_Hector joins the other two to spectate as well, his gas mask still on and still holding his drone._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:58 PM)_

_Iris's dagger is covered in flame, being generated closely but not actually touching the dagger._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:58 PM)_

> "What is going on out there"

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 05:58 PM)_

_Having snapped out of his dreadful thoughts about Sanya, Emmett just smirks at Matieu like an asshole._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:58 PM)_

> I realized something today...

_Iris's grip tightens around her blade._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:58 PM)_

> Y'know what, fuck you homie.
> That was my bitch.
> She still is!

_Matieu gives Emmett a weak dig on the shoulder._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:59 PM)_

_Hector continues to speak in a muffled Martian from his gas mask._

> Etas camos sumtim?

Martian: Shouldn't we do something?

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:59 PM)_

> I may have lost everything that night.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 05:59 PM)_

> I know where you sleep, Tawfeek.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 05:59 PM)_

> But I am not left with nothing.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 05:59 PM)_

> Penes apis trous Matieu, camos sumtim!

Martian: Matieu get your head out of your pants, we have to do something!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:00 PM)_

_Matieu frowns, having understood Hector's Martian._

> Well I was going to and then he fucked Iris while clothed in a pool!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:00 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes and scoffs._

> Hector, get your translator on.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:00 PM)_

_Matieu physically gags._

> His jizz is probably in the gelatin!

_Matieu points at the pool._

> I think I can see it there!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:01 PM)_

> I am not alone.

_Iris looks over to Emmett in her peripheral vision and gives him a slight smile._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:01 PM)_

_Hector walks away muttering to himself in Martian because he's disgusted with Matieu._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:02 PM)_

_Emmett sighs from Matieu's ignorance and hangs his arms from the balcony, beat from the chaos and dread._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:02 PM)_

> `Dread`: Oh, but we are.

_`Dread`: Dread grabs Iris's chin and forces her to look into their eyes._

> `Dread`: And you?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:02 PM)_

_Matieu sighs and looks back to Hector._

> Hey, come back hector, I'm sorry!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:02 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread laughs once more._

> `Dread`: You will forever be alone.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:02 PM)_

> You're wrong.

_Iris pulls away from Dread, grimacing._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:02 PM)_

> `Dread`: You will be trapped by the ghosts of your sins.
> `Dread`: When this is over, you won't be alone anymore.

_`Dread`: Dread's smug smile falls._

> `Dread`: It'll be you...
> `Dread`: And the only emotion you'll feel.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:03 PM)_

_Iris takes a deep breath and extinguishes her blade._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:03 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread readies their blade._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:04 PM)_

_Hector walks back in the room putting his comms and translator on._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:04 PM)_

> Okay, is it working Hec?

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:04 PM)_

_Iris readies her dagger._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:05 PM)_

_Hector pinches his nose in disgust._

> Okay now, what happened?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:05 PM)_

_Emmett groans and looks back at Hector._

> Also, Hector, I didn't fuck Iris!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:05 PM)_

> I almost feel bad for you...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:05 PM)_

_Matieu lifts his arms and balls his fists._

> You asshat!
> Why didn't you tell me that!?

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:05 PM)_

_Emmett cringes from Matieu's response._

> Why would you assume that, idiot?!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:05 PM)_

> Umm...
> I don't know...

_Matieu taps his beak in thought._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:05 PM)_

> The gelatin would clearly be a disgusting mess otherwise.

_Emmett returns to watching Iris and Dread._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:05 PM)_

> I assumed, but that doesn't matter right now, we have to help before we lose two crew members!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:06 PM)_

> I'm just really protective of her...

_Matieu sighs._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:06 PM)_

> `Dread`: I would take that as a threat...

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:06 PM)_

> It's sad, really.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:06 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread snarls._

> `Dread`: But I don't care enough about your words.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:06 PM)_

> You'll never know this feeling.

_Iris's body starts to heat up, from a mix of firey adrenaline and hope._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:06 PM)_

> Do we need to intervene? This is looking bad!

_Hector grips onto the railing out of concern._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:07 PM)_

> I haven't lost everything.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:07 PM)_

_Emmett squints his eyes and looks at you, the reader. He huffs before muttering._

> I would help, but Dread's interference with the plot is holding me here.

_Emmett looks back to the action playing out and rests his chin on the railing._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:07 PM)_

> Yeah, no duh.

_Matieu gets up and puts an arm around Hector._

> Almost as bad as that gas incident, Hec.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:07 PM)_

> I've made friends now.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:07 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes at his own comment. Apparently Dread's influence on him has appeared to drain the energy from him._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:07 PM)_

> So that means...
> Iris gains a dangerous edge.

_Iris gives a devious smirk._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:08 PM)_

> At least it was only knockout gas...

_Hector shrugs._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:08 PM)_

> You're the only thing standing between me and my happiness.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:08 PM)_

> Next time leave your comms on.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:08 PM)_

_Iris, seizing the opportunity, attacks, swiping at Dread._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:08 PM)_

> I didnt want to be distracted while I fix my drone!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:09 PM)_

> And Hector, I still don't have any real weapons.

_Matieu pats Hector on the back._

> Where's my Subsonic Stim? My guns?

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:10 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:10 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 5, Jelsafan0.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:10 PM)_

> I gave you the stim gun!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:10 PM)_

_Matieu gets confrontational, pushing his beak into Hector's face._

> Did you give me the ammo? Is it subsonic?

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:10 PM)_

`Dread`: t!roll d30

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:10 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d30... Rolled a 19, Brakia.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:11 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 6, Jelsafan0.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:12 PM)_

`Dread`: t!roll d30

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d30... Rolled a 17, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:12 PM)_

> `Dread`: Attacking me is useless.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:12 PM)_

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 7, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:12 PM)_

> I'll do it anyways.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:13 PM)_

`Dread`: t!roll d30

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d30... Rolled a 7, Brakia.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:13 PM)_

_Iris heats up her dagger._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:13 PM)_

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:13 PM)_

> `Dread`: Give up.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:13 PM)_

> No. I won't!

_Iris dodges another attack._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:14 PM)_

> I hate being an audience member.

_Emmett exhales, deflating._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:14 PM)_

`Dread`: t!roll d30

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d30... Rolled a 8, Brakia.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:14 PM)_

> Agreed...

_Hector leaves and comes back with a bucket of popcorn._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:14 PM)_

> Dread is purposely making it so that I can't move.

_It's unsure whether Emmett telling the truth or not, but it's funny to imagine it's not true._

`Dread`: t!roll d30

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d30... Rolled a 20, Brakia.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:15 PM)_

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

> `Dread`: You can't go on!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

> I won't stop.
> I won't stop until you leave.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett try to jump off the balcony?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

`Dread`: t!roll d30

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d30... Rolled a 18, Brakia.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:17 PM)_

_Iris collapses to her knees. She shakily raises her dagger._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:17 PM)_

> `Dread`: I'm so sorry.

_`Dread`: Dread scoffs._

> `Dread`: I didn't want to do this.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:17 PM)_

> ... Why?

_Iris trembles, beginning to accept her fate._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

> `Dread`: I will leave you with one last gift...

_`Dread`: Dread looks down at Iris with murderous intent._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

> ... Why do you have to take... everything?

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

> `Dread`: Your father would be proud.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

_Hector realizes he can still move his arms so he scorpion walks away._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

_Iris sniffles._

> ... Thank you.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

_Emmett looks back after having tried to jump off the balcony._

> Hector, get me my crossbow!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:18 PM)_

> `Dread`: You are welcome.

_`Dread`: With apathy, Dread raises their blade._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:19 PM)_

> On it. I'm getting the M.O.A.D. This ends now!

_Hector races to his and Emmett's rooms to grab their weapons. Thankfully, Hector's extra legs and scorpion walking technique make him really fast!_

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:19 PM)_

> `Dread`: Send him my regards.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:19 PM)_

_Iris looks to the ground, tears in her eyes._

> I'm sorry... Bridgette...

_Iris shivers and takes a deep breath._

> I failed.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:20 PM)_

_Hector returns with his rifle and Emmett's crossbow, tossing it over to him._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:20 PM)_

> `Dread`: Tell him... Tell him my job is nearly finished.

_`Dread`: Dread lowers their blade a bit and decides to toy with their prey, cutting into Iris's cheek._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett aim his crossbow at the monster?

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:21 PM)_

`Dread`: t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 4, Brakia.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett aim his crossbow at the monster?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Zander.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:21 PM)_

_Emmett's hands shake as he tries to aim at what was once his friend. He can't bring himself to shoot Sanya._

> I can't do it.

_Emmett drops Opportunity, his beloved plasma crossbow, onto the balcony table._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:21 PM)_

_Iris's teary eyes close gently. She lies in a critical state, collapsed to the ground._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:21 PM)_

_Hector stands up and takes out the chamber of his rifle._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:21 PM)_

> It's Sanya.
> Just do it for me.

_Emmett frowns and closes his eyes._

> She's... family.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:21 PM)_

> `Dread`: As for the rest of you...

_`Dread`: Dread watches their spectators and gives them a false salute._

> `Dread`: I make my leave. With my vessel.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:22 PM)_

> No!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:22 PM)_

_Hector loads the M.O.A.D and its chamber into his rifle._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:23 PM)_

_`Dread`: Evidently feeling some remorse, Dread leans down and puts Iris in a peaceful pose._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:23 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector hit Sanya in the neck with the M.O.A.D?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, MultiTheDuck.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:23 PM)_

_`Dread`: As Dread begins to make their leave, they're suddenly struck in the neck with a heavy-calibur, neurotoxin-laced bullet! Not expecting this, they falter, and spew out viscous, black sludge from their mouth and neck._

> `Dread`: -Urk!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:23 PM)_

> I wouldn't want to be you...

_Hector starts to load up another bullet into his rifle._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:23 PM)_

> Hell yeah!

_Matieu pumps his fists in the air._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:23 PM)_

_Iris's body looks peaceful... yet inexplicably sad._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:24 PM)_

> SUCK A DICK!

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:24 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread crumbles to their knees, falling to the ground, a puddle forming around them._

> `Dread`: I- uh-

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:25 PM)_

> You want to go?
> How's pain feel, huh?

_Matieu humps the air._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:25 PM)_

> I'm sorry Sanya, I can't let you kill anyone...

_Hector grimaces as he watches her fall to the ground._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:25 PM)_

_A black cloud exits Sanya's body._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:25 PM)_

_Emmett finally falls off of the balcony, having regained his mommentum, ends up falling flat on the gelatin._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:25 PM)_

> Iris... I'm sorry...

_Sanya's body falls next to Iris, still spewing out more tar._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:26 PM)_

> Let me get out there, Hec!

_Matieu puts up his dukes cartoonishly._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:26 PM)_

_Iris' hand slides off of her stomach, onto the ground._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:26 PM)_

_Emmett winces in pain from the extreme drop into the pool, rubbing his cheek._

> I REALLY should be more careful next time...

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:26 PM)_

_Hector finally puts his normal chamber in and then crouches to the floor, all six hands to his face._

> Did I mess up?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:27 PM)_

> No, you killed it.

_Matieu is still dancing._

> That's all.
> It had to be done!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:27 PM)_

> Maybe I could have stopped it another way...

_Hector sighs._

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:27 PM)_

_Emmett wobbles on the gelatin, having managed to land in a more solidified spot. He looks up to the balcony and gives them a thumbs up._

> You've got her...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:27 PM)_

> It was just gonna come back again.

_Matieu gasps and stops dancing._

> WAIT WHERE THE FUCK IS IRIS?!

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:28 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett stand on top of the gelatin?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:28 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Zander.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:28 PM)_

_Emmett's legs tremble, both from the gelatin beneath him and the sudden loss he's had from Sanya's passing._

> I really feel underdressed for this funeral...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:29 PM)_

t!8ball Do I run the fuck over to iris and start doing resuscitative procedures?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:29 PM)_

> God, you can't die now...

_Matieu lies Iris on her back and starts to do frequent compressions on her chest._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:29 PM)_

> What have I done....

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:29 PM)_

_Matieu puts his beak to Iris's mouth, all lustful thoughts dissipating from him._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:29 PM)_

_Iris is limp, and a tad cold- though that could just be the sliminess of the pool from earlier._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:29 PM)_

> C'mon, c'mon...
> CPR!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:30 PM)_

_Hector drops his rifle and thinks to himself, "Pull it together Hector, you might be able to save them!"_

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:30 PM)_

_Emmett looks down at his swim trunks and then to Sanya, who is limp with pestilence. He tears up._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:31 PM)_

t!8ball Is Iris still breathing?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:31 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:31 PM)_

_Matieu puts his ear canal to Iris, searching for any breathing or a heartbeat. He hears nothing in response._

> FUCK!
> HEC, GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE!
> I THINK SHE HAS AEROSLIME IN HER LUNGS!

_Matieu continues to press on her chest, his mind wandering everywhere._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:31 PM)_

_Hector continues to think to himself, "Are they still alive? Come on Hector, you got this!" He looks behind him, trying to conjure up any solution to keeping Iris alive._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:32 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu do rapid CPR, constantly checking Iris's heartrate?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:32 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Enchantingtable2013.

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:32 PM)_

_Emmett walks to the side of the floran and rests his head on her chest, like a puppy whose owner has just passed away._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:32 PM)_

> C'mon, C'mon!
> WAKE UP!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:33 PM)_

_In Iris's mind, she stands in her white dress, no wind blowing. She's humming her dad's lullaby._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:33 PM)_

_Hector stands up shakily and starts walking down the stairs to the pool._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:33 PM)_

> You are not dying on me right now!

t!8ball Does Matieu continue doing CPR and mouth to mouth?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:33 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:33 PM)_

> Get up already!

_Matieu, frustrated, slaps Iris's face a bit._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:34 PM)_

_Hector arrives at the pool, his expression sullen as ever._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris begin breathing again?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:34 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:34 PM)_

> Oh, thank god!

_Matieu stops, trying to give Iris some space._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:34 PM)_

_In Iris's mind, a voice joins in._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu slap her so hard that Iris wakes up?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:34 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | No, Enchantingtable2013.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:34 PM)_

> Matieu, get her to the sick bay!

_Hector points back to the ship as he walks over to Sanya and Emmett to see the damage he's done._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:34 PM)_

> Will do!

_Matieu, still a little weak from earlier, struggles to pick up Iris. Eventually he does, and he starts to make his way to the Slingshot's medbay._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:35 PM)_

_In Iris's mind, she whips around, and the sight she's met with brings a giant grin to her face._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:35 PM)_

_Hector winces, seeing how pitiful Emmett and Sanya look. He pats Emmett on the back, a bit unsure of what to do._

> Emmett... I'm sorry...

**Zander** _(15-Sep-18 06:35 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett weep softly, to the point of him falling asleep?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:35 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Zander.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:35 PM)_

_Matieu shrugs off his pain and dashes quickly to the medbay with the power of the warhero and with Iris on his shoulders._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:35 PM)_

_Hector trembles, his mouth furrowing. "What have I done?"_

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:36 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu continue mouth to mouth?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:36 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Enchantingtable2013.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:36 PM)_

_As Iris continues to dream, six figures stand there. "Mom? Dad? You're- you're all here!" She laughs out, running to them. She hugs them tightly._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:36 PM)_

> C'mon, wake up already!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:36 PM)_

_Hector turns away from his sin and heads toward the medbay. "I'm going to let him sleep, he needs it..."_

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:37 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu slap Iris ten times in an attempt to wake her up?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Enchantingtable2013.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:37 PM)_

_Hector runs off to the medbay._

> Okay I'm here! Now, what's her status?

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:37 PM)_

_Still dreaming, Iris hears her father bellow from behind. "Hello, my daughter." She grins and twirls around to see him. "Dad!" Iris enthuses, her voice cracking a tad._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:37 PM)_

> Poor, but she's breathing now.

_Matieu wipes some sweat from his forehead._

> Thank god.
> I haven't have a single sexual thought since Dread arrived...

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:38 PM)_

> Let's see if we can stabilize her...

_Hector heads to a counter and fills up an IV bag._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:38 PM)_

> I just want to protect her now...

_Matieu holds Iris tightly._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:38 PM)_

_"Dad," a thought strikes Iris. "W- wait. What about Dread? What about my friends?"_

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:38 PM)_

> That's good, we can talk more about it later, right now let's see if we can save her...

_Hector hangs up the filled IV bag and grabs a syringe, prepared to stick it into Iris's left arm._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:39 PM)_

> Okay...

_Matieu gets off of Iris, scratching his beak anxiously._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:39 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector stabilize Iris's condition through the IV bag?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:39 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, MultiTheDuck.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:39 PM)_

_"All is well, Iris," her father soothes. She relaxes a bit._
_A thought strikes her, and she takes a few stumbling steps back. "Dread. Dread, how do you know Dread?"_

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:41 PM)_

> `Iris's Dad`: It's not important right now, my dear. What's important is that we're all together.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:43 PM)_

_Iris is skeptical. "But, Dad... He... asked me to give you a message. He asked me to tell you that his job is almost done."_
_"I wanna know what's going on. I deserve to know what's going on."_

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:44 PM)_

_`Iris's Dad`: Iris's dad shows physical discomfort on his face._

> `Iris's Dad`: Please Iris. We're a family again. Please, just enjoy it.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:45 PM)_

_Iris' brows furrow. "But- but-"_

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:46 PM)_

> `Iris's Dad`: Iris! Please, don't question it. Just...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:46 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu stare at Iris, angered by what had happened?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 06:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Enchantingtable2013.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:46 PM)_

> `Iris's Dad`: Just accept it.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:46 PM)_

_Hector peers over at Matieu, smiling softly as he tries to make what just happened into a lesson for them to learn._

> What happened today, Mat?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:46 PM)_

> I can't believe that such a...

_Matieu gestures air quotes with his wings._

> ... "god" would hurt someone.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:46 PM)_

> Where did it go wrong, bud?

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:47 PM)_

_Iris takes a closer look around. "... Where... where are they, Dad?"_

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:47 PM)_

> I hate Florans.

_Matieu gives a vengeant expression, clenching his beak and balling his fist._

> I hate them all.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:47 PM)_

_Hector puts a comforting arm on Matieu's shoulder._

> Calm down, it wasn't her fault.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:47 PM)_

> They almost killed me, they almost killed the ones I love.
> They're just vessels of evil!

_Matieu slams his fist down on the bed._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:48 PM)_

> She couldn't control the possession or what happened after...

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:48 PM)_

> `Iris's Dad`: It's because...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:48 PM)_

> She had "full control".

_Matieu glares at Hector._

> Supposedly.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:48 PM)_

> `Iris's Dad`: It's because we're different.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:49 PM)_

> Then she let go of that little control...

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:49 PM)_

_"...What?" A cloud of black smoke wafts into the room._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:49 PM)_

_`Dread`: Dread appears in the mindscape and snatches Iris's dad's arm._

> `Dread`: We need to talk, General.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:49 PM)_

> `Iris's Dad`: Now?

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:50 PM)_

_"... Dad? ...You're working with him?"_

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:50 PM)_

> Hector, I have a burning rage for their people.

_Matieu takes a deep breath and exhales loudly._

> It's not necessarily their fault, but I hate them for it.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:51 PM)_

_Iris takes a few steps back, again, in her mind._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:51 PM)_

> `Iris's Dad`: I have to go now darling. I will be back later.

_`Iris's Dad`: He waves to Iris before turning around._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:51 PM)_

> You will get over it Matieu, most are great people... Do you not remember our trip to their planet?

_Hector remembers fondly of the time he and Matieu went to a moon with tons of florans. It just so happened that that moon was a cleverly disguised brothel._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:51 PM)_

_Iris turns and runs into the blackness._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:51 PM)_

> I can't remember with this cloudy vision...
> All I know of them is what just happened.

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:52 PM)_

> `Iris's Dad`: IRIS!

_`Iris's Dad`: Iris's dad turns around and holds his hand out for her, screaming out of her concern. Dread prods him in the direction they're headed._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:52 PM)_

> And it fills me with hatred...

_Matieu gives a malicious expression._

**Brakia** _(15-Sep-18 06:52 PM)_

> `Iris's Dad`: IRIS, COME BACK!

_`Iris's Dad`: Iris's dad and Dread suddenly disappear as Iris leaves them, falling into the void._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:52 PM)_

_Iris is falling... falling... After a while, her eyes snap open. Her mother is in front of her. "Mom?"_
_Her mother smiles kindly. "I love you, Iris. But it's time to wake up now."_
_Iris rushes to hold onto her mother. "Wait, Mom-!"_

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:52 PM)_

_Iris jolts up while panting, finally conscious. She's sweating considerably, dousing the medical bed in kerosine._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:53 PM)_

_Matieu bolts up at Iris's sudden revival._

> Is she awake, Hector?

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:54 PM)_

_Iris tries to control herself, but she's hyperventilating a bit._

> ... What... what happened?!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 06:54 PM)_

> Too much.
> Way too much...

_Matieu holds Iris's hand without her realizing it._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 06:58 PM)_

> She's awake?

_Hector looks up at Iris with a grin._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 06:59 PM)_

> ... Sanya. Where's Sanya? Is she okay?!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 07:00 PM)_

> She...

_Hector frowns._

> Don't worry about her, she's happier now, just try and get some rest for now, you almost died.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 07:03 PM)_

> I-I need to see her, I have to tell her something!

_Iris tries to stand up from the bed, but her legs give out, and she collapses to the floor._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 07:06 PM)_

_Hector rushes to Iris's side, propping her back up._

> No relax, you can't wake up Emmett. He needs the escape currently. And you need rest. just stay there... I can write it down for you so you can remember if you want.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:06 PM)_

> You can't go Iris.

_Matieu helps Hector lift Iris back into her soaked bed._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 07:06 PM)_

> But- I-

_Iris sighs._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:06 PM)_

_Matieu hisses at the thought of Sanya._

> And we have to dispose of the body soon.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 07:06 PM)_

> Th-

_Iris's eyes widen._

> The... body?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:06 PM)_

> Don't think about it...

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 07:06 PM)_

> Relax, you'll knock your tubes out and that could kill you.

_Hector tucks Iris into the bed, making sure her IV bag is still properly secured._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:06 PM)_

> The good thing is that you're alive.

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 07:07 PM)_

_Hector slaps Matieu's face after his previous comment about Sanya._

> Matieu! Be quiet!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:07 PM)_

_Matieu takes the slap and doesn't retaliate, whispering to himself._

> And I will never, ever, let something like this happen again.

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 07:07 PM)_

_Iris, with great effort, gets out from the covers and struggles to her feet._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:07 PM)_

_Matieu attempts to push Iris back to the bed._

> Sit down!
> You'll hurt yourself!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 07:07 PM)_

_Iris appears to be glowing, like an ember, flickering._

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 07:07 PM)_

> No, Iris you need to stay where you are!

_Hector grabs Iris's arm and pinches the IV tubes._

> At the very least let me take your tubes out properly!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:07 PM)_

> Oh no...

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 07:07 PM)_

_Iris's eyes, too, glow. She wrings herself out of Hector's grasp, staring into the distance to where Sanya lies._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:08 PM)_

> Iris, sit down and calm yourself.
> It's too early to assess the situation!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 07:08 PM)_

_Hector gasps at Iris's reaction._

> Matieu, we may need to put her to sleep!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:08 PM)_

_Matieu digs in his pack and stares at his Subsonic Stim. He loads it up with Torpor darts, packed with enough tranquilizers to quickly take down a horse._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 07:09 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris pull out the tubes with no care for her life?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 07:09 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Jelsafan0.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:10 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu fireh is shot and hits her in the neck?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 07:10 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:10 PM)_

> Please!

_Matieu lunges to grab Iris, however he misses her and slams on the tiled floor._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 07:10 PM)_

_Iris breaks into a wobbly run after being stimmed. She stumbles every few seconds, dashing through the halls._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:10 PM)_

> Please, Iris, don't!

_Matieu pushes himself up from the ground and watches Iris leave._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 07:10 PM)_

_With fiery tears in her eyes, Iris runs out to find Sanya, fearing for the worst._

> S-Sanya!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:10 PM)_

_Matieu chases after Iris._

> You're not alright!
> Please, get back here!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 07:11 PM)_

_Hector sighs and tries to fix the tubes. He's broken this family from his actions. He just tried to keep everyone alive and safe._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 07:11 PM)_

_Iris makes it onto the pool deck and spots her two friends collapsed on the ground. Sanya is certainly dead._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:11 PM)_

_Matieu speaks into his comms watch as he reaches Iris._

> You do that, Hec, I'll get her!

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 07:12 PM)_

_Tears continue to pull their way out of Iris's eyes, evaporating quickly._
_She falls to her knees, hands slamming onto the vinyl._
_Her hands and knees are scraped up from the fall._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:13 PM)_

> God bless it...

_Matieu crouches down to pick up Iris._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 07:13 PM)_

_Dread's words play on repeat in Iris's mind, again and again._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:14 PM)_

_Matieu puts his arms around Iris, anticipating she will fall asleep soon._

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 07:14 PM)_

_The phrase, "You will forever be alone." resonates in Iris's mind._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:15 PM)_

> Please Iris, don't look any longer...

**Jelsafan0** _(15-Sep-18 07:15 PM)_

_The heat emanating from Iris dies down, it sapping away even her body heat. Her eyes flutter closed as she passes out._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu grab Iris over his shoulder and run her back to the medbay?

**Tatsumaki** _(15-Sep-18 07:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(15-Sep-18 07:17 PM)_

_As Matieu races back to the medbay, he cries out._

> What have I done?!
> What have WE done?!

**WatchfulDrake** _(15-Sep-18 07:22 PM)_

> I don't know, but we need to try and fix this.
