t!8ball Does Emmett wake up from the pilot's seat?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Concentrate and ask again, Zander.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:15 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya finally get her outfit right?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:15 PM)_

> ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:15 PM)_

_Sanya sighs in relief, having managed to find a pair of shorts that properly fit her body._

> Finally...
> Some shorts that fit.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(30-Sep-18 02:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu go to the fridge, only finding all the bread is gone?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(30-Sep-18 02:16 PM)_

_Matieu slams the pantry door closed, irritated._

> WHO ATE ALL THE DARNED BREAD?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:16 PM)_

_Seth rubs his eyes and gets up from his messy bed and last night's hookup. He gets up and heads to the kitchen, making a mental note to airlock the lady sleeping on his bed later._

> We used it for dinner last night.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:17 PM)_

_Jim was doing pushups in his room, holding his bionic arm behind him._

> Five hundred ninety nine... Six hundred!

_Jim picks himself off the ground and flexes his arm. He breathes deeply out of partial exhaustion._

> I don't think I even broke a sweat!

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:17 PM)_

_As it turns out, Emmett ate the last crumbs of bread. He's peacefully sleeping in the pilot's chair._

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:17 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner finish tuning up Chompsky's flamethrower?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:17 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Deyner.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:17 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth airlock a female shapeshifter that Emmett had some alone time with?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:17 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Concentrate and ask again, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:17 PM)_

t!8ball Has Seth airlocked the fridge?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:17 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Ask again later, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:17 PM)_

_Iris is ribbon dancing in her room with her stuff pushed out of the way._

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:17 PM)_

_Deyner yells in an attempt to get Chomsky's attention, given that he does not have a comms watch yet._

> Chomsky!!
> Chomsky!! Come to my room!!!!

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:18 PM)_

_After overhearing Matieu over the comms, Jim gives an audible, sarcastic sigh._

> Why are you guys so scared about losing food, we'll find something eventually.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:18 PM)_

_Seth checks the pantry and notices a sack of potatoes on the floor that have started to rot, the package having been nibbled into._

> We could always go raid an asteroid farm.

_He stands up and takes out his Desert Eagle, searching about to find any pests lurking on his ship._

**ProfessorTree** _(30-Sep-18 02:18 PM)_

t!8ball Is KYL300 discharged?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Ask again later, ProfessorTree.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:19 PM)_

_Jim tries his best to mimic Matieu's voice, rolling his eyes._

> Emmett, I dont feel so good... Wah, wah, wah.

_Jim's voice becomes gruff._

> Nut up, Matieu!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(30-Sep-18 02:19 PM)_

_Matieu snaps at his watch, his gizzard growling._

> Oh, shut up! Your body's like half robot. You subsist off of nuts and bolts.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:19 PM)_

_After not receiving a response from Chomsky, Deyner puts the finished flamethrower on his workbench._

> Eh, time to get working on other stuff...

_Deyner takes out an incomplete prototype of his to regulate his icy disposition and starts to tinker with it._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:19 PM)_

_Garrick peeks out of the hallway and into the kitchen, watching Seth patrol around the kitchen and nearby rooms like a soldier._

> What?

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:19 PM)_

> Yeah, an asteroid farm doesn't sound like a bad idea.

_Seth cocks his gun as he notices the couch being misaligned, and crumbs leading into a busted ventilation cover._

> If the spacesuits didn't get cut up during that space pirate battle, that is.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:20 PM)_

_Jim looks around his room and groans. Another day stuck in deep space, another day wasted doing nothing._

> Well, since we have nothing better to do, I guess I'll start installing the camera systems. Just in case we land.

_Jim leaves his room, heading towards a supply closet._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(30-Sep-18 02:20 PM)_

_Matieu moans as his gizzard continues to grumble._

> Man I could really go for some sourdough right now...

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:20 PM)_

_As Iris continues to ribbon dance, the ribbon catches on her leg and she falls with a thump._
_She sighs, closing her eyes._

> I think that's enough for today...

_Iris picks herself up from the floor and puts her ceremonial ribbons on a shelf._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:20 PM)_

t!8ball Does Jim find the resources needed for a camera system?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, TheBlade.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:20 PM)_

_Deyner feels his stomach as it growls. He sneaks into the kitchen to grab a snack, but ends up finding out that there's no food._

> Darn.

_He silently walks into his room before being notices by the others, disappointed._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:21 PM)_

> Well, I guess we are out of everything...

_Jim shuts the supply closet door._

> No food, no equipment... soon we'll run out of feul.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick come out through the door to regroup with everyone?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, RPretribution.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:22 PM)_

_Garrick smacks his ghostly lips and looks around for the others, given that most of them have left the kitchen._

> Where are you guys?

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:22 PM)_

> We need to get some Ducketts...

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:23 PM)_

_Seth finds the culprit of the hole gnawed into the potato sack. He covers an ear before shooting it point blank with his Desert Eagle._

> Don't worry about fuel, I made sure to stock up on fuel at the last fuel station, maybe like 10 space miles back.

_Seth grabs the stowaway rodent by its tail._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:23 PM)_

_Jim jumps from the nearby gunshot._

> What the hell?! We're under attack!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:23 PM)_

> Yeah, we're under attack... By fucking rodents...

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:23 PM)_

> Couldn't you have warned us before shooting in the living room?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:23 PM)_

> My ship, my rules.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:23 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett wake up and quietly yawn in his position?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:23 PM)_

_Iris grabs Ignis and walks out of her room. Where to go? She hums softly._

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:24 PM)_

_Deyner shuts his door and puts on some protective headgear before laying out the mould for a kusarigama._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:24 PM)_

_Emmett stretches and rubs his eyes. He takes out his wrist and speaks into the ship's comms, his tone unenthusiastic._

> Morning, everyone.
> This is your pilot, Emmett speaking.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:24 PM)_

_Jim walks around the ship, checking on all the systems._

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:25 PM)_

_Deyner takes out a vial and pours it into the mould. He then takes out a hammer and slams it into the mould._
_CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!_

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:25 PM)_

> We're over twenty equinoxes into the depths of the Outer Rim and with little to no food...

_Emmett sighs._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:25 PM)_

_Seth drags the rodent over to the kitchen counter._

> That's why we have Sanya.

_He takes out a knife and starts to skin the poor creature._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:25 PM)_

_Iris sighs and mumbles._

> We already know that, Emmett...

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:26 PM)_

_Sanya rolls her eyes and interjects into her wrist._

> Seth, I'll stab you.
> Then we'll see who's food.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:26 PM)_

_Garrick takes out a pillow from his pockets and smothers his face into it, dying of boredom as his fellow crewmates have had to conserve their energy. He speaks into his pillow to Seth, muffled._

> Don't eat Sanya.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:26 PM)_

_Emmett realizes his sullen tone and acts a bit more cheery. There's no need to be so down._

> However, that doesn't mean we need to get our spirits down.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:26 PM)_

_Sanya stands from her bed and puts on her sword carrier, just in case._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(30-Sep-18 02:27 PM)_

_Matieu sits at the table in the kitchen, watching Seth chop up the rodent._

> Since when did the plant come back to life?

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:27 PM)_

_Jim makes his way to the cockpit, waving down Emmett._

> Is there anything in our path to land?

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:27 PM)_

_Deyner whips out his phone and sends Emmett a message from it._

> "I have at least one days worth of rations if needed :)"

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:28 PM)_

t!choose kitchen | cockpit | pool | lounge

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:28 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | Brakia, I pick pool!

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:28 PM)_

> Guess I'll head to the pool.

_Sanya takes a deep breath and walks to the pool, her hand cautiously near her Dreadsword._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:29 PM)_

_Emmett eyeballs Jim and gets distracted by his CrabPhone vibrating. He whips out his phone and sends Deyner a message back._

> "For twelve people, Deyner?"

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:29 PM)_

t!8ball Does Chomsky abandon Garrick and meet Sanya at the pool?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, PlasmaPerson.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:29 PM)_

_Garrick picks his face up from his pillow and watches as Chomsky ditches him._

> Well, jeez'. Alrighty then.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:29 PM)_

_Deyner sends another message._

> "I don't eat breakfast or lunch Emmett"

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:29 PM)_

_Chomsky rolls his eyes as he opens the door to the pool._

> We'll talk later, garrick.

_Chomsky shuts the door to the pool behind him and comes across Sanya, who is currently just staring at the pool._

> Hey, Sanya.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

_Sanya tilts her head a bit towards Chomsky, her body still facing the pool._

> What are you doing here?

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

_Garrick blows a raspberry at Chomsky and floats through the door to the lounge. He sits on their futon and turns on the holovision, bored._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

> Hey, Emmett, is there any place to land soon?

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

_Chomsky raises an eyebrow, puzzled by Sanya's response._

> What? I'm not allowed to use the pool?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

_Emmett taps on his navigation panel and zooms out, seeing nothing of value._

> Not that I know of, Jim.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

_Sanya relaxes her body, realizing how tense she seems._

> It's just strange to see you here...

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:30 PM)_

_Deyner opens up his door and screams._

> Chomsky!!! Come get your flamethrower!

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:31 PM)_

_Chomsky, unable to hear Deyner, leans on the wall and folds his arms._

> As opposed to somewhere else on the ship?

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:31 PM)_

_Garrick peeks up from the futon, having heard Deyner clearly._

> OOH! I WANT IT!

_He quickly floats to deyner's room to snag the flamethrower._

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:31 PM)_

> Hm...

_Sanya's hand is instinctively on her sword handle._

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:31 PM)_

> No, Garrick!

_Deyner holds Chomsky's flamethrower tightly._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:31 PM)_

_Chomsky puts up his hands and shakes his head, finding it absurd that Sanya is so on edge._

> Relax. I'm not going to kill you.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

_Emmett gets up and stretches. His fur is roughened up and matted from how hungry he's been._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

_Iris sighs._

> Well, Sanya seems to have gone back to the pool, so pool it is, I guess.

_Iris turns around and heads back to her room to change into her swimsuit._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

_Garrick clasps his hands repeatedly, nearing the flamethrower._

> Give it to me here, I'll give it to him.

_Garrick smirks._

> Yeeeaaah...

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

_Seth grows tired of slicing up the rodent and leaves it on the countertop. Instead, he heads to Iris's room and opens the door slightly, peeking in._
_He watches as she undresses, smiling to himself._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

_Emmett speaks over the ship's intercom._

> You guys going to the pool?

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

_Deyner sighs and lifts the flamethrower away from Garrick._

> Chomsky, I swear to god come get your mother trucking flamethrower or I'll give it to Garrick!

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

_Overhearing Deyner's voice from Garrick's active comms, Chomsky speaks into his wrist._

> I don't even have my weapon right now, Garrick.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

_Jim puts a finger to his mouth and leaves the cockpit in open thought._

> Might need to check on the cell to make sure its up... Just in case we manage to run completely out of grass again.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

_As Iris strips down to her undergarments, she notices that her door was opened. She furrows her brow angrily as she notices Seth entering her room._

> Get the hell out, Seth!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

_Seth rolls his eyes and groans._

> No fun.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:32 PM)_

_Jim chuckles to himself and puts his watch to his face._

> Don't want that to happen again, do we Emmett?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:33 PM)_

> Huh? I didn't get what you said.

_Emmett stands from the pilot's seat and holds his stomach._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:33 PM)_

> Chonk, don't come get your weapon.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:33 PM)_

> Go. Away!

_Iris covers her chest._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:33 PM)_

> But I'm at the pool. Have Deyner bring it to me.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:33 PM)_

> He's gonna steal it...

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:33 PM)_

> I would never steal it, Deyner.

_Garrick holds out his hands for the flamethrower._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:33 PM)_

> Well then, you paragon of virtue. You bring it to me.

_Chomsky heads to the pool restroom and changes into some swim trunks. Afterwards, he dips his toe into the gelatin._

> The pool's quite heated. Feels a bit off from normal water.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:33 PM)_

_Sanya shrugs and watches as Chomsky slips into the pool._

> Guess it was already heated up from last night.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:33 PM)_

> Okay...

_Deyner reluctantly gives Garrick the flamethrower._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris shove Seth out of her room and lock the door?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:34 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:34 PM)_

> Iris slams the door and locks it behind him.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:34 PM)_

_Deyner looks around Garrick._

> Move Garrick, I need to speak with Chomsky, wherever he is.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:34 PM)_

> Psst... you can just go through me to the pool.

_Garrick admires Chomsky's flamethrower._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:34 PM)_

_Emmett weakly walks over to the poolside._

> Hey guys...

_Emmett coughs._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:34 PM)_

_Seth folds his arms angrily._

> Jeez, what a rude woman.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:34 PM)_

_Sanya notices Emmett's disposition and heads over to him._

> Hey Emmett.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:34 PM)_

_Deyner, as directed, walks through Garrick and to the pool._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(30-Sep-18 02:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu also head to the pool area?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:34 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Reply hazy try again, Enchantingtable2013.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:34 PM)_

_Iris holds her head back in irritation and changes into her swimsuit quickly before unlocking the door and heading to the pool._

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:35 PM)_

_Following Iris, Deyner also makes his way to the pool._

> Chomsky? Where are you?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:35 PM)_

_Emmett whines like a puppy._

> Sanya, I feel weak, man.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:35 PM)_

_Chomksy flows within the pool, his body lying face up. He softly waves, focusing on keeping himself afloat._

> Over here, dude.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:35 PM)_

_Sanya glares at Deyner and Iris entering the pool area._

> Why is everyone coming to the pool?

_Sanya shakes her head and regains her focus on her best friend._

> What's wrong, Emmett?

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:35 PM)_

> Its the place to be, Sanya.

_Chomsky inhales, enjoying himself. He grabs a pool floaty and sits atop of his, staring up into the void._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:36 PM)_

_Iris scoffs._

> I came here to swim, duh.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:36 PM)_

_Deyner heads to the the closest part of the pool side to Chomsky, making sure not to enter the pool._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:36 PM)_

> We've been out of food, you know...

_Emmett's stomach growls._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:36 PM)_

_As Jim ensures the brig is ready, he speaks into his watch out of concern._

> Wait... Someone check on the grass supply!

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:36 PM)_

_Emmett's body twitches after hearing Jim mention grass._

> And also, out of the... g-thing...

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:36 PM)_

> Thank you, Deyner, you're a lifesaver.

_Chomsky stares at Deyner, not bothering to leave the pool._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:36 PM)_

_Seth leans in the doorway to the pool, propping the door with his leg._

> We had grass sandwiches last night.

_Seth mumbles._

> Emmett ate most of it.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:36 PM)_

_Sanya eyeballs Seth as he enters._

> I see.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:37 PM)_

_Iris sits on the side of the pool, dipping her feet in._

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:37 PM)_

_Deyner blinks, having expected Chomsky to jump out of the pool and grab the flamethrower from Garrick, wherever he is._

> No problem...

_He looks behind him at Emmett._

> Emmett I need to talk to you.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:37 PM)_

_Seth scowls at Emmett._

> Hence why we're out of bread...

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:37 PM)_

_Emmett furrows his brow at Seth's comments._

> Shut up, Seth. I didn't eat shit last night.

_He perks up, shifting back to Deyner._

> Yes, Deyner?

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:37 PM)_

> Can you follow me?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:37 PM)_

_Emmett shrugs._

> I mean, I can. But why?

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:38 PM)_

_Chomsky feathers his fingers through the aeroslime._

> What is this pool made of, Anyway?

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:38 PM)_

_Garrick plays around with the flamethrower, pretending to shoot it at various things in Deyner's room, complete with various pew sounds and raspberries being blown._

> Where is everyone...?

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:38 PM)_

_Not bothering to give Emmett an answer, Deyner walks to the navigation room._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:38 PM)_

_Iris sighs, closing her eyes and relaxing._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:38 PM)_

_Emmett watches as Deyner leaves him in confusion._

> Okay?

_After a couple of moments, he sighs and follows him into the cockpit._

> Fine then...

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:38 PM)_

_Garrick pockets Chomsky's flamethrower and looks around the ship for a little bit, eventually ending up at the pool._

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:38 PM)_

_Sanya stands behind Iris, peering down at her horns._

> Hello, Iris. How are you?

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:38 PM)_

_Garrick enters the pool area with the others._

> 'Sup.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:39 PM)_

_Chomsky snaps at Garrick from his pool seat._

> Yo.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:39 PM)_

> It's like a gelatinous liquid of sorts, real relaxing. Forgot what it's called.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:39 PM)_

_Iris beams up at Sanya._

> A little tired.

_Her smile droops after a moment of silence between them._

> A little hungry, a little stressed.
> Otherwise, fine. Yourself?

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:39 PM)_

_Garrick grabs some sunglasses, puts them on, and tips them in Chomsky's direction._

> Yo period.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:39 PM)_

_Seth's stomach rumbles._

> Unfortunately not edible though.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:40 PM)_

_Sanya observes Iris and notices her swimsuit. She them looks at her own adornments._

> I'm glad I have a proper outfit, but overall, I'm good.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:40 PM)_

> You know, Garrick, you could be looking for ways to get food, considering you don't need any for yourself.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:40 PM)_

_Seth takes out a tablet of sorts, metallic red like the Panty Slingshot. He taps on it a bit, accessing an inventory remotely._

> Shit, we're out of cigs and space weed...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(30-Sep-18 02:40 PM)_

_From within the kitchen, Matieu glares at Seth judgmentally._

> You druggie.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:40 PM)_

_Deyner taps on the navigation console to Emmett's chagrin. He accesses a planet, dragging across the screen to get a better look._

> This is Jegon-8. It's a food abundant place that's ran by a warlord.

_Deyner looks over to Emmett apathetically._

> We can take it if you want.

_Without skipping a beat, he goes back to his room and works on his kusarigama._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:40 PM)_

_Emmett scoffs at Deyner's abrupt leave and views the map he's been offerred._

> Well, bye then.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:40 PM)_

> Yeah, well, I doubt I already have anything.

_Garrick shrugs as he floats over the pool._

> I don't need to eat, so I don't keep food on me.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:41 PM)_

_Chomsky kicks some aeroslime at Garrick._

> No, I mean use maps and stuff to find a planet with food.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:41 PM)_

_Seth groans._

> Space weed isn't considered a drug in the GU, birdbrain.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:41 PM)_

_Iris hums a lullaby her father used to sing her as she sits and kicks her legs, feeling content for the first time in a while._

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:41 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner successfully make the weapon?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:41 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Concentrate and ask again, Deyner.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:41 PM)_

_Garrick gives Chomsky a puzzled expression._

> Where would I find that? We're in the middle of space.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:41 PM)_

_After checking the map, Emmett notices the coordinates of the planet Deyner provided him. He yells across the hall as Deyner's room is fairly nearby._

> This is on the other side of the galaxy, Deyner!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(30-Sep-18 02:41 PM)_

_Matieu rolls his eyes at Seth's namecalling._

> Space weed is a gateway drug, whether legal or not. Had a patient who started smoking bowls a while ago. Guess what?
> Guy's overdosed three times on morphine since. The guy is addicted to morphine now.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:41 PM)_

_Deyner pops his head around the corner._

> You said we needed food, I presented a answer.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:42 PM)_

_Chomsky speaks into his comms, overhearing Emmett's dialogue._

> I dunno. Can't this thing go light speed?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:42 PM)_

_Emmett scowls and drags his wrist to his mouth._

> Light speed will kill you all in the pool area.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:42 PM)_

> We can't go at light speed. We're not made of light.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:42 PM)_

> This raid could easily feed us for months, Emmett!

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:43 PM)_

_Chomsky softly exhales._

> Well hyperspace or something then.
> I dunno'.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:43 PM)_

_Garrick activates his comms and excitedly speaks into it._

> Did I hear raid?

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:43 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth leave the others and chill on his bed, looking through magazines?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:43 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:43 PM)_

_Iris has been ignoring her comms, so Garrick's excitement comes as a shock to her._

> ... No?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:44 PM)_

_Emmett starts to calculate how long it would take to bring the Panty Slingshot to Deyner's destination._

> Deyner, I don't think this is viable...

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

> I could direct some of the unnecessary power and reroute it to the engines...

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett see something else of interest on the navigation panel?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, TheBlade.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

> I'm down for a raid. I'd finally get to use my flamethrower for something useful.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

_Jim enters the cockpit, noticing that there's something in the distance in the windshield. He immediately looks to the radar, not seeing whatever's there._

> Is this thing even working?

_Jim points at where the blip on the radar should be, diverting Emmett's attention._

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

_Deyner scoffs at Emmett's decision._

> Why not? This could feed us for a while and it's run by a corrupt warlord?

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:45 PM)_

_Seth puts down his full page view of a naked Chromatin human wrapped in crimson drapes to speak into his watch._

> We're not doing a raid on a warlord.
> Final answer. Sorry.

_Seth shakes his head and gets back into his zone._

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

> Trying to raid a warlord would be suicide.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

_Iris straightens her back._

> Good choice.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick find a marshmallow in his pockets?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, RPretribution.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

t!8ball Rather than seeing something on the panel, does Emmett see a intergalactal toll station?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Zander.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

> T'would be beneficial to raid the guy.

_Deyner blinks._

> And we would have a steady stream of food from the grateful villagers on the planet though.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

_Emmett gasps from Jim's observation._

> Something in the front!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

_Seth's eyes glaze over as he looks over his lewd magazines._

> Oh wow.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:46 PM)_

> Anyone want a marshmallow?

_Garrick shakes the marshmallow in Sanya's face._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

> Why the hell isn't it showing on the panel?

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

_Iris raises her hand._

> I'd like the marshmallow!

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

_Sanya pushes Iris's hand to the side._

> I do!

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

_Emmett speaks over the ship's intercom._

> I think it's a deep space station, guys!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

> Looky there, a toll station...

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick eventually give the marshmallow to Sanya?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Brakia.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

> Wait, Garrick, you just pulled a marshmallow out of your pocket. What other food have you got in there?

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

> Iris asked first.

_Garrick throws the marshmallow to Iris._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:47 PM)_

_Iris catches it._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:48 PM)_

_Emmett tunes into the toll stations's frequency._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:48 PM)_

> Thanks.

_Iris observes the marshmallow, twisting her wrist._

> I appreciate it.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:48 PM)_

_Jim leans on the pilot's chair._

> Let's see what they have to say....

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:48 PM)_

> Panty Slingshot to Toll Station.... Y-28.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:49 PM)_

> Well, that was quick.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:50 PM)_

_Jim looks over to Emmett and mumbles._

> What is the purpose of this toll?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:50 PM)_

_Emmett mutes the mic._

> Think this might be a hyperlane from the Outer Rim to the Galactic Union, I hope. Usually hyperlanes want some tribute to use them.

_Emmett gives Jim a shrug._

> But your guess is as good as mine.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:50 PM)_

_Iris gets a sudden headache after holding the marshmallow._

> Ah, did you want this, Sanya?

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner successfully finish his kusarigama?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Deyner.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Toll Station Y-28 to Panty Slingshot, we hear you loud and clear.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

_Iris looks up at Sanya, holding the marshmallow up to her._

> ...Sanya?

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 02:52 PM)_

_Sanya glares at Garrick and grits her teeth._

> I asked first, ghost. Iris raised her hand.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:48 PM)_

_Deyner, holding his kusarigama, heads back to the pool._

> Sanya, you're our chemist, right? I was thinking on making a mixture of sorts.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner let Chomsky be the chemist like he is?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

_Chomsky pulls himself from the pool and butts in between Deyner and Sanya._

> Whatcha' need, Deyner?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:53 PM)_

_Emmett unmutes the nav mic._

> Y-28, is there civilization on the other side of this hyperlane?

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

> Do you have any chemical mixtures that burn for a while?

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

_Chomsky rubs his fingers together, feeling a faint stickiness from being in the aeroslime._

> Pretty much everything. Yeah.
> But, what do you mean by a while? A long while or a short while?

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

_Iris sighs and just eats the marshmallow because Sanya isn't answering._

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:54 PM)_

_Deyner tries to compose himself to mask his intentions, but he does so poorly. He appears to be up to no good._

> Can you bring some to my room?

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

_Iris gives a distrustful half-glare to Deyner._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

_Chomsky raises an eyebrow._

> M'kay...

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Depends on which lane we choose for your ship to go through.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

_Chomsky heads to his room and brings a chemical container labeled "t5G" to Deyner's room._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:55 PM)_

> We need the closest civilization to here...

_Emmett accesses the crew's bank account and realizes that they're quite broke._

> We're out of D's though.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

_Deyner grabs the chemical container._

> Thank you, Chomsky.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

_Chomsky tilts his head._

> What do you need it for?

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

_`Toll Station Operator`: The operator sounds apathetic to the crew's financial woes._

> `Toll Station Operator`: Well, Slingshot, guess you can't go through then.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

_Deyner gives a guilty smile._

> Nothing...

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

_Emmett sighs and browses to the crew's credit tab. It's looking quite rough._

> Take my credit, Y-28.
> I'll pay it later.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

_Garrick looks out the poolside, noticing the toll booth. He speaks into his comms._

> Oh, for Dread's sake. Is there any other way we can get around it?

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:56 PM)_

_Chomsky nods slowly._

> Uh huh... Welp, I'll trust you know what you're doing. See ya'.

_Chosmky slowly edges out the room and heads back to the pool._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

_`Toll Station Operator`: The operator groans audibly over the mic._

> `Toll Station Operator`: Let me check your tab.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris actually get in the pool?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Jelsafan0.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:57 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Panty Slingshot, it says here you have over 13,000,000 Ducketts in debt for the tolls.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

_Jim's eyes cartoonishy bulge out of his head from hearing the amount._

> Thirteen... million?!!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Sorry can't let you through until you pay.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

_Deyner peeks into the kitchen from a hallway and yells._

> Iris, can you please come to my room?

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

_Iris stands in the shallow end of the pool, and frowns._

> What for?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

_Emmett is taken aback from the Operator's response. While the VP's GU debt is poor, it's not thirteen million Duckett poor._

> Y-28, I think you're mistaken. Are you reading our dues upside down? I've paid every time we've gone through these.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

> A surprise...

_Deyner heads back to his room ominously._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

_Iris sighs heavily._

> Fine.

_She gets out of the pool, grabbing a towel and wrapping it around her, following Deyner._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:58 PM)_

_Chomsky casually watches as Iris leaves the pool, tipping his sunglasses to get a better look at her figure._

> Man...

_He then dips back into the pool from his floaty and holds himself at the top._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 02:59 PM)_

_Seth turns another page in his lewd magazine and finds an insect-like creature with dozens of legs in a bikini. He huffs in disgust and turns to another page._

> Guess me having sex with them wasn't enough to stop them from putting it on my tab.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:59 PM)_

> How have I never been in this pool before?

_Chomsky relaxes his body in pure bliss._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 02:59 PM)_

_Garrick inspects the gelatin, dipping a ghostly finger into it._

> How does this pool even work?

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 02:59 PM)_

_Chomsky shrugs._

> No clue. I just know it's fun.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

_The moment Iris enters his room, Deyner hands her a box without looking at her._

> Here. This is to say, I'm sorry for the offense I caused when we first met.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

_Garrick sits on top of the pool, not really understanding how Chomsky was so relaxed in the slime._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

_`Toll Station Operator`: The operator drones on, not even bothering to double check their number they provided._

> `Toll Station Operator`: Once you pay, then you can pass.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

_Iris gives Deyner a puzzled look, arcing her neck back in defense._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

_Emmett taps his head on the navigation console in frustration._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Otherwise I'm gonna have to ask you to leave
> `Toll Station Operator`: There's like four other ships in the queue behind you.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:00 PM)_

> Hey Garrick?

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

> Yeah?

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

_Jim watches as Emett tries to think of some response to the stalwart operator._

> Emmett, I can attempt to get into their system and make them think that we paid...

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

> So you're a ghost. Does that mean you had a past life?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

_Emmett groans and speaks into the ship's intercom._

> Does anyone have thirteen Ducketts on hand? Just thirteen I need. The crew's account is broke-broke.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

> Open it, Iris.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

_Seth widens his eyes at a beauty on his magazine and verbally shoos Emmett away._

> Check inside your butthole, Emmett.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

_Garrick looks up and ponders Chomsky's question._

> ... You know, I have no idea.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

_Iris hesitantly takes Deyner's box and opens it. Her eyes widen as she sees his kusarigama he worked on earlier._

> Is this...?

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:01 PM)_

> I saw you like ribbon dancing so I made this for you.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

> Don't worry Emmett, I got this.

_From the comfort of his bedroom, Seth taps into the console from his tablet._

> Toll keeper. This is the captain of the Vortox Pummelers speaking.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Was I not speaking to the captain before?

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

> No. He's like a vice captain. I'm the captain captain.
> Anyhow, I hear we have some debt we need to cover.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

_Chomsky smirks at Garrick._

> Hmm. No brain, no memories, I guess. No offense.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

_Emmett groans at Seth's predictable attempt to prostitute himself to let them pass. He turns on the intercom once more._

> No one have any spare Ducketts?

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Yes. Thirteen million Duckett debt. If you don't pay up, I'll need to call a tow company or arrest you all.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

_Seth speaks into his wrist, away from his tablet before returning to it._

> Master diplomat right here, watch.

> Operator, I think your voice sounds cute, so I presume you're also cute.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

> I might...

_Sanya checks her pockets._

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

_Deyner exclaims in his room, as if Emmett could hear him._

> I think I saw some on the kitchen counter!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth convince the toll keeper to have sex with him in exchange for free passage?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

t!8ball Does Jim find some change in his wallet?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, TheBlade.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

_Iris picks up the chain and hook and admires it dumbfoundedly._

> Did you make this?

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

_Garrick snaps at Chomsky, giving him a short-lived glare._

> Hey, I'm not the one that burned his own parents.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

> You happen to be a woman, correct?

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Yes, but I don't see that as relevant.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

> Well, I am infamous across the galaxy for being a master at pleasuring pretty women, if you catch my drift.
> We can have a fun time if you just let us through.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: That's terribly inappropriate, captain. I happen to be married.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

_Seth rolls his eyes and mumbles._

> Fuck! That usually works.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

t!roll d50

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d50... Rolled a 8, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

_Jim takes out eight plastic credit slips from his pocket._

> I got about... eight Ducketts, Emmett.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

_Chomsky widens his eyes and sits up in offense at Garrick's retort._

> What did you just say?

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

> Yes, and you can light the chain and blade ablaze and it won't melt!

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

_Iris examines the kusarigama with fascination._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

_Emmett speaks over the intercom, holding the credit slips in his hoof._

> We need five D's!

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:03 PM)_

_Garrick is unfazed by Chomsky's offense._

> I read your log. You write a lot in there.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

_Deyner sends a message to Emmett._

> "I said I saw some on the kitchen counter"

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Sorry Panty Slingshot, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick have five stolen ducketts?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, RPretribution.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

_Chomsky sneers._

> First of all, that's private. You shouldn't be looking through my belongings. Second...
> That was an accident.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

_Garrick, half-listening to Chomsky, checks his pockets and happens to come across five credit slips._

> Yo! Emmett! I found 5D!

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

_Emmett sighs in relief and speaks into the nav mic._

> Wait, wait! We have the cash. Relax.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

> It's in the past...

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:04 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: I don't appreciate the sexual advances your captain made upon me.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

_Jim pushes Emmett aside and nearly shouts into the microphone._

> Just let us pass, we got the D's!

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

_Emmett grunts and shoulder's Jim out of the way._

> The captain has...

_Emmett thinks for some obscure disease Seth mentioned to him in the past._

> ...Parkinson's disease. I apologize.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

> Is the weapon satisfactory, Iris?

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

_Seth folds his arms and mumbles._

> Sexual advances, smexual advances.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

> Yeah, yeah, whatever. Let's just get through the toll.

_Garrick takes his Ducketts over to Emmett and helps him load them into a exporter for the toll operator to examine._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:05 PM)_

_Chomsky glares at Garrick as he heads back to the pool._

> You've got to promise you won't tell anyone about that.
> I'm serious.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

_`Toll Station Operator`: The operator begrudingly uses the station's tractor beam to extract the crew's export. They open it up and examine the Duckett credit slips._

> `Toll Station Operator`: Hmm, seems one of these ducketts is counterfeit...

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

_Jim groans._

> Alright, lady, do we really need to report ya?

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

_Iris gives Deyner a respectful nod._

> Yes. Thank you.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett get pissed off?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Zander.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

_Emmett's hackles raise on his neck. He's tired, hungry, and in no mood to deal with governmental incompetence._

> I think you're counterfeit, bitch.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:06 PM)_

_Deyner smiles._

> No problem. I hope we can be friends.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_Garrick gives Chomsky a devilish grin._

> I'll keep it secret if you let me borrow your flamethrower.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_`Toll Station Operator`: The operator starts to dial in the number for the Galactic Union Hyperlane Authority._

> `Toll Station Operator`: Nice "no u", loser. I'm like one digit away from calling the cops.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_Jim, noticing Emmett's stature, speaks into the microphone to try and ease the tension._

> We got the Ducketts. You are holding up traffic, and we really need to pass.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Should've thought about that earlier, hun.

_`Toll Station Operator`: The operator finishes dialing the number for GUHA._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_Unable to control himself, Emmett dives into his room and grabs his crossbow, Opportunity._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_Iris extends her hand and smiles lightly._

> Iris Bellatoria.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_Emmett loads up his Opportunity with some ship-bursting cells._

> Let us through or pay the toll.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_Chomsky is furious._

> I will go to the ends of the earth, learn every archaic spell to have ever existed, and I will strike you down.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:07 PM)_

_Garrick puts a mocking finger to Chomsky's nose._

> You can't kill a ghost, dummy.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Hmm... No. Sorry, the police have been called.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> Deyner.. Deyner Revathen.

_Deyner shakes her hand, noticing her heightened body warmth._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

_Chomsky swats at Garrick's hand._

> That's what the archaic spells are for, dummy.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

_Emmett flicks a switch and starts to charge up his crossbow, the plasma beam humming and oscillating._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

> Alright, lady, can you just open the damn gate?

_Jim sighs._

> Do you really want that paperwork on you for this incident?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

_Emmett bares his canines._

> The police don't care about us.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

_Garrick rolls his eyes and tosses Chomsky's flamethrower at him._

> Alright, I'll just get another flamethrower then.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:08 PM)_

_Deyner continues working on something else in his room._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: I don't deal with the paperwork, I'm just an intern.

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

t!8ball Does Hector wake up?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, MultiTheDuck.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

_Emmett groans loudly._

> They won't waste their energy for a legally paying bounty hunting group.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

> Not that I really care about your family issues, anyway.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

_Iris turns._

> I'm gonna go see what the holdup is. Thanks again.

_Iris exits Deyner's room, heading to the cockpit._

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

_Hector stretches his legs out and yawns._

> Oh no, I overslept again.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:09 PM)_

_Chomsky tosses his flamethrower out of the pool and gives his most intimidating glare at Garrick._

> Stay outta' my stuff, nimrod.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

_Iris notices Emmett's hackles and his heavy breathing as she enters the cockpit. She puts a reassuring arm on his shoulder._

> Is... there a problem in here?

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: If you want, I can let you talk to a manager before the police arrive to arrest you.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

_Garrick rolls his eyes._

> I'll try, but you know me. Stealing is my nature.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:10 PM)_

_Emmett focuses on intimidating the toll station worker, barely noticing Iris's touch._

> I can let you talk to my Opportunity first.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya head to the cockpit?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

_Sanya scans the cockpit and heads to Emmett's side, opposite of Iris. She raises an eyebrow at Emmett's disposition._

> What's happening in here?

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: That makes no sense, sir.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

_Deyner decides to stop working on whatever he's working on and joins in on the fray._

> Why are we stopped again?

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

> Alright, bring your manager to inspect the D's please.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

_Emmett tries to manage his breathing as his fur noticeably darkens._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

_Iris rubs Emmett's shoulder with her thumb and leans her head into the microphone._

> I'm sorry, ma'am, but what exactly is the issue?

_Iris tries to be very polite, her diplomacy skills coming in handy._

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

_Sanya gives Emmett a puzzled look._

> Emmett. Are you alright?

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

_Chomsky leaves the pool while muttering various insults at Garrick, not bothering to pick up his flamethrower._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

> Or else...

_Jim turns on his thermal vision and notices Emmett's body heat increasing._

> Emmett, you feelin alright? You're burning up, man.

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 03:11 PM)_

_Hector looks throughout the ship at the normal meeting spots, finding no one._

> Where is everyone?

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

t!8ball Does Chomsky meet the others in the cockpit, still in his swimsuit?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

_Emmett looks back at the Iris and Sanya, his teeth still showing angrily. His voice is gruff and a bit strained._

> I'm pissed!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Counterfeit Ducketts, sexual advances, and holding up traffic. You're getting arrested because of your captain.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

_Chomsky leans in the doorway and flicks a lighter._

> Find anything yet?

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

_Sanya pushes Emmett's crossbow down and stares him dead in the eyes._

> Emmett. You need to calm down.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

_Iris gives a side-eye to Emmett with a slightly irked expression._

> Oh! Lovely!

t!8ball Does Iris whisper to Emmett, "Can I set the booth on fire?"

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes at Iris's suggestion and starts to aim his weapon right at the station's window._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Chomsky overhears Iris's question._

> No oxygen in space, Iris.

_He flicks his lighter._

> You need oxygen for fire.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Sanya gasps and shakes Emmett lightly._

> Emmett!
> You need to calm down, Now.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Iris grumbles._

> There's oxygen in the booth...

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

> Let's be civilized, Emmett. There's no need to act so brash.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Jim glares at Chomsky._

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:13 PM)_

_Deyner digs in his pouch and takes out fifty Ducketts. That's nine hundred USD._

> Lady, if you wish, here's what was owed and a bit extra for you to forget this happened.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

_Chomsky groans, thinking that Emmett's too angry to reason with._

> Seth, shoot him before he does something he'll regret!

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

t!8ball Does the toll worker accept the bribe?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Deyner.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

_Seth speaks into his comms before tapping into the navigation mic again._

> I'm not shooting my son, asshole.

t!8ball Does Seth make more sexual advances upon the toll booth worker and convince her to have sex with him in exchange for passage?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

> Ma'am?
> I'd like to ask you a question.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:14 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Sorry, but my decision still stands, no sex for you. Just prison.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:15 PM)_

> If we're going that route, just crash the ship through the toll booth.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:15 PM)_

t!8ball Does Jim use his thermal vision to detect how many people are inside the toll booth?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, TheBlade.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:15 PM)_

> I swear to the gods this is the most uncorrupt toll booth worker ever

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

t!roll d5

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d5... Rolled a 5, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

> Lady, I can see that there are four other people inside your toll booth, can we speak to anyone else?

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:16 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Please leave this instant, otherwise we will use force.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

_Deyner pushes a button on the console that causes the windshield to drop, leaving only an oxygenated, permeable barrier similar to the pool area's._

> DEATH TO THE INFIDELS!!

_Deyner grabs his bow and starts shooting at the toll station._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

_Emmett ignores Deyner and flicks the safety off of his weapon now._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

_Iris sighs heavily and snaps her fingers, small embers emitting._

> Can I ignite her already? Pretty please Emmett?

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

t!roll d15

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d15... Rolled a 11, Deyner.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

_Deyner shoots eleven arrows at the toll station's window. All of them circle around where the toll operator is standing, either embedding themselves into the window or bouncing off of it._

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

> DAMN YOU SPACE!!

_Deyner slams down his bow._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:17 PM)_

> Lady, SHUT THE HELL UP AND BRING YOUR MANAGER FOR GOD'S SAKE!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:18 PM)_

_`Toll Station Operator`: The operator is unfazed by Deyner's arrows, given that the ones that remained in the window were barely in._

> `Toll Station Operator`: Please leave otherwise we will use force.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:18 PM)_

_Jim slams his fist into the console._

> Alright, I'm done with this.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:18 PM)_

> Let us through or perish-

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:18 PM)_

_Iris interrupts Emmett, standing in the way of his shot._

> ACTUALLY!
> I MIGHT HAVE AN EXTRA DUCKETT!

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

_Sanya scoffs at Emmett's uncharacteristic bloodlust._

> EMMETT!

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

_Deyner rushes to his room to try and craft a bomb gun of sorts._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

> `Toll Station Operator`: Alright, we've given you ample opportunity to leave. Initiating combat.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

_Iris places some emphasis in her wording, hinting that she wants to immolate the people in the tool booth._

> If only I could get INTO THE TOLL BOOTH TO GIVE HER THE MONEY WE OWE.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner make the bomb gun?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:19 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Reply hazy try again, Deyner.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 03:20 PM)_

> Wait, Garrick!

_Deyner exclaims into the cockpit._

> Just float over and her possess her??

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:20 PM)_

_Chomsky shrugs and lights a cigarette._

> Good idea, go do it, Garrick.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:20 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick possess the booth worker?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, RPretribution.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:21 PM)_

_Garrick sticks a foam finger to his ghostly chin._

> I could just possess her...

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:22 PM)_

_`Toll Station Operator`: The operator tells the gunner aboard the station to open fire at the Panty Slingshot, who then shoots a shot at their engine._

`Toll Station Operator`: t!roll 10D13

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a 10d13... Rolled a 9, a 6, a 11, a 8, a 3, a 8, a 3, a 13, a 12, and a 3, making 76, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

_Seth grips onto his bed as the ship wobbles from the sudden shot._

> FUCK!

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

_Emmett manages to keep his composure despite the ship's rocking and takes a deep breath._

> Okay then. My turn.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

_Chomsky's sunglasses fall to the floor from the ship._

> Woah, ok. What weapons have we got?!

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

_Iris falls to the floor and holds onto Emmett's hoof, growing desperate to... want to murder the people on the station._

> Can I PLEASE JUST SET HER ON FIRE?!

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

_Emmett grits his teeth and shoots directly at the toll booth worker through the window._

t!roll 10d75

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a 10d75... Rolled a 69, a 3, a 16, a 59, a 46, a 55, a 32, a 45, a 67, and a 11, making 403, Zander.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

_Opportunity recoils wildly from the energy concentrated within its blast after it expels, a direct hit shattering the window and a significant portion of the station._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:23 PM)_

_Garrick drops his foam finger as his jaw drops to the ground from Emmett's attack._

> Are you trying to blow her up?!?!

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

_Chomsky grabs his glasses from the ground and puffs his cig._

> Better than starving, I suppose.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

_Emmett's knees tremble and he drops._

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

> Emmett! What are you doing!?

_Sanya manages to catch Emmett before he hits the floor._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

_Chomsky maniacally chuckles._

> Do that again Emmett!

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:24 PM)_

_Emmett holds his head while in Sanya's arms._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

> If she's not dead from that, someone could go into the toll booth, kill her, and turn on the gate.

_Iris blinks her eyes repeatedly with a smile, clasping her hands together._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

_Seth overhears the blast from Opportunity._

> Oh fuck!
> Once you've confirmed she's dead, Emmett, ram through the gate!

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

_Sanya stares daggers into Iris._

> Why are we killing her?!

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

_Hector finally makes his way to the cockpit with the others._

> What's this commotion?!

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

_Iris pouts and folds her arms._

> Because she's rude.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

> Because she doesn't want to have sex with me!

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

_Chomsky puts his sunglasses on and grins._

> We're killing people.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:25 PM)_

_Jim shakes._

> Do we really need to blow up a TOLL BOOTH for ONE DUCKETT?!?

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

_Chomsky puffs his cig._

> We don't got money.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

_Emmett's muscles tense up, his headache developing into a migrate._

> Oh, fuck...

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:26 PM)_

> It's not about the Duckett, Jim!
> It's about her attitude!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(30-Sep-18 03:27 PM)_

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:27 PM)_

_Iris looks down at her brand new weapon._

> ... We could use this?

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 03:28 PM)_

> Whats happening?!

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:28 PM)_

_Emmett whines in pain._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

> Should I just go over there and possess her body? Seems a lot easier.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

> Emmett's dying, I think.

_Chomsky taps his cigarette on the wall apathetically._

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

> Are you okay, Emmett?

_Hector scrambles for anything medical that could be of use._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

> Yes, Garrick! Possess her so I can burn it all!

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

> Alright, I'm on it.

_Garrick exits through wall of the Panty Slingshot and starts to make his way to the station._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:29 PM)_

> We don't have time to just sit here!?

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

_Jim puts his mouth up to the microphone._

> Alright, whoever is in that damn toll booth, we have a medical emergency, if we can't get through someone might die here!

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

_Iris scoffs._

> She was about to kill us, do you think she cares if we die?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

> `Navigation Console`: The number you are trying to reach is not answering right now.

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick possess the toll booth lady and let the ship through?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:30 PM)_

_Jim folds his arms._

> Lets see how long this will last.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew just ram the tollbooth with the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:32 PM)_

> Fuck this shit, we need to get Emmett to a hospital.

_Sanya drops Emmett to the floor lightly before rushing to the console and attempting to pilot the ship towards the hyperlane gate._

> Shit, shit, shit...

_Unfortunately, Sanya's lack of expertise in piloting ships over 300 megatonnes in weight causes her to ram the ship directly into the toll booth! Thankfully, before they impact, she manages to get the windshield back up!_

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

_Chomsky braces for impact._

> Welp, here we go...

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

_Watching Sanya mess with his console illicts a soft bleat in despair from Emmett._

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

_Realizing they're about to ram into the toll booth, Sanya tackles Emmett, guarding him._

> Emmett, hold on!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:33 PM)_

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

_While in the void of space, Garrick watches the spectacle with a hint of concern in his voice._

> I CAN'T HEAR ANYONE, IS EVERYONE OKAY?!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

_Seth kicks off some rubble from his bed, his shoulder and torso torn into._

> G-God damnit...

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:34 PM)_

_Jim grabs Sanya's ankle in a rage._

> WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU RAM INTO THE ONLY WAY TO OPEN THE DAMN GATE?!

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:35 PM)_

_Sanya slams her foot down, causing Jim to release his grip in pain. She breathes heavily and stares down at Emmett, her back punctured by scraps of metal._

> W-Well, the booth's gone...

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:35 PM)_

> Space Rule #96: Don't go through intergalactic toll booths!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:36 PM)_

> Fuck the space rules right now.

_Seth coughs from breathing in metallic particles._

> Why the fuck did you not possess her, you useless fuck?!

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:36 PM)_

_Garrick sharply exhales in disbelief._

> You blew her up!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:36 PM)_

> I didn't touch the controls.
> I'm in my room, jackass!

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:36 PM)_

> There were five lifeforms on that toll booth...

_Jim scowls at Sanya._

> And you rammed into it...

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:36 PM)_

> Right. Emmett blew her up.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya ram the ship downward in a stressful reaction?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_Iris chokes out and watches as Sanya grabs the controls once more._

> WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ARE YOU D-DOING SANYA?!

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_Garrick just watches as Sanya attempts to throw their lives away._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_Iris screeches incoherently._

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_As Sanya attempts to get the crew out of there, the controls cause the ship to dive down. She attempts to stop the ship's acceleration, but the controls bust open, leaving the console inoperable._

> What have I done...!?

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew somehow crash on a random planet?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, TheBlade.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:38 PM)_

_`Panty Slingshot`: The ship manages to make its way into an inhabited planet's orbit and falls, turning into a firey ball of metal that happens to protect the crew from the impact. Many crewmembers are singed, but thankfully, none happen to be gravely injured._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Iris pushes herself up from the floor, her body slightly burned and trembling from the impact._

> W-We're on land now!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

> Oh..

_Seth looks down from his bed, seeing the others in the cockpit. Apparently in taking the blow of entering the atmosphere, Seth's room curled over the cockpit._

> Okay, everyone leave the ship before this thing explodes.

_Seth drops from the bed and slides down from his room, landing in the cockpit. He holds a hand over his shoulder in pain._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Chomsky spits out some blood, his lip busted up from the crash._

> I'm so c-confused...

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Seth points out the ship._

> Sanya, you go first as a test.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

> Okay... We must find a new ship again.

_Sanya leaves the rubble of the ship and into the forest. The crew happened to land along a cliffside, and had a glorious view of an autumnal landscape with a waterfall leading into a river._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

> WE CRASHED! AGAIN!

_Garrick facepalms and floats out of the ship crash._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Jim's robotic arm is dislocated from the impact, however he's able to make it out without an issue._

> Wait, why the hell didn't we see this planet?

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:39 PM)_

_Iris quickly exits the ship, making sure to bring her belongings this time. She doesn't want a repeat of last time._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:40 PM)_

_Chomsky climbs the ship rubble and grabs his clothes from whatever's left of the pool area. He slides down and jumps, landing on the grass below him._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:41 PM)_

_While everyone else acts in a panic, Emmett lies in the fetal position in the engine room, his cheek and ears cut into._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

_Iris notices Emmett amidst the rubble and motions for him to come to her._

> Come on! Get out here!

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

> Alright something is definitely wrong with our nav system...

_Jim raises his functional arm to his head and gets a good look at the destroyed ship._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:42 PM)_

_Garrick frowns and eyeballs the unconscious squoatling._

> Emmett doesn't look too good...

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

_Chosmky scoffs and puts his hands to his hips._

> Just get him to eat the wildlife, he'll be fine.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:43 PM)_

> Come help me collect grass for him...

_Iris leans to the ground and pulls out some weeds along the mountainside._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

t!choose grassy | rocky

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | RPretribution, I pick grassy!

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

> Yo, Iris, there's grass here.

_Garrick points at the ground in a grassy location, not bothering to help with her efforts._

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

_Hector leaves the rubble and makes his way to the others._

> Wait... Sanya?

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

> Emmett's gonna be fine.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

_Chomsky struggles to see that Emmett is incapacitated._

> Come outside, Emmett.
> There's juicy grass just for you!

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

_Iris makes her way to the grassy area Garrick pointed out._

> Help me collect said grass!

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:44 PM)_

_Sanya tilts her head._

> Yes, Hector?

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

> I thought you died.... How are you still alive?

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

> Being re-planted. Didn't we discuss this before?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:45 PM)_

_Emmett remains inconveniently placed in the engine and begins to fry up from the burning engine fluids._

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 5, Zander.

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

_Hector lets out a sigh of relief and slaps his head a bit._

> Sorry, memory's been a bit foggy lately. Been drinking a lot since I... well... shot you...
> I really am sorry about that.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

_Iris quickly begins to collect grass._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:46 PM)_

_Chomsky smells deeply, catching a whiff of burning flesh. A familiar stench._

> Guys, I think Emmett's burning alive.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

_Seth sticks out his tongue and rubs his stomach stupidly._

> Yum, yum! Fresh fried goat!

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

_Once Iris has a good amount of grass, she rushes back into the ship in a panic._

> Where's Emmett?!

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:47 PM)_

_Jim heads to the engine of the ship, planning to try and salvage any parts he could._

> Alright, lets see whats going on-

_Jim smells Emmett burning._

> The fuck?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

_Emmett wakes up finally and chokes from the metal dust from the impact. He feels his arm burning and he recoils in pain._

> ACK!

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

> Hey! Where is Emmett!? I have grass!

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

> There's tons of grass out h-

_Garrick turns around and notices the others heading back to the ship to save Emmett. His face changes to that of a realistic, ugly close up shot, like from Spongebob._

> Guys, I think Emmett's in trouble.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:48 PM)_

> He's in the engine, don't worry.
> He's only burning alive and all.

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

> What happened to Emmett?!

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

> Oh god.

_Jim pushes aside some ship wall and happens to see Emmett struggling to get out._

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

_Iris catches up to Jim and screams at the sight of Emmett._

> What the hell?!

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

_Emmett tries to push out his legs for the others to help him out._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

_Jim grabs one of Emmett's exposed hooves._

> Iris, grab hold of his other leg.

**Jelsafan0** _(30-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

_Iris, flustered, chokes up at the thought of Emmett potentially dying. Fortunately, she grabs ahold of his leg and helps him out of the engine with Jim._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:49 PM)_

_Chomsky raises an eyebrow._

> How did he even get in there?

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 03:50 PM)_

_Hector runs to the engine room with the others and takes out some burn medication._

> Oh god, Emmett!

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_Emmett shivers and croaks out._

> Why me...

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_Jim, Iris, and Hector carry Emmett to some safer, smoother terrain and lower him to the ground._

> I got you buddy, the doctor's going to do his best to help you...

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

t!roll 3d10

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a 3d10... Rolled a 8, a 6, and a 8, making 22, WatchfulDrake.

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 03:51 PM)_

_Hector does his best to heal up Emmett, applying various ointments and chemicals into his scorched body._

> It's the best I can do on short notice, but you'll heal up fine. Your arm's got the worst of it, so we'll probably need to patch that up better when we find a medical center.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya explore the planet on her own?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:52 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Brakia.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

_Jim gives a sigh of relief and lifts Emmett over his shoulder._

> Thanks doc.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew leave the ship area and search for other lifeforms?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:53 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is decidedly so, PlasmaPerson.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

> Cone on guys, we can't starve out here.

_Chomsky heads off in the nearest direction towards the valley beneath them._

> Need to find something to kill and eat.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

_Emmett just continues to groan and hold his head._

t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d10... Rolled a 10, Zander.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:54 PM)_

_Emmett shakes, his muscles tensing up intensely. The burns and impact of the ship have only exacerbated The Crave._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth drink some water from a river?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:55 PM)_

_Seth gives a toothy smile._

> Ya' know, this planet certainly is beautiful.
> Reminds me of the magical forests in Elven legends.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

_Jim hands Emmett over to Sanya._

> I think I'm going to work on the ship, take care of him.

t!8ball Does Jim start working on the exterior of the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, TheBlade.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

> What? I'm trying to look for food, Jim!

_Sanya sighs and keeps a tight grip on her best friend._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

_Garrick gasps in excitement and points at some life he's found._

> I found a bunch of weird-looking animals!

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

> Nice!

_Chomsky takes out his flamethrower, which he also grabbed from the crash._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

> We can cook these.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

t!8ball Is there grass here sustainable for Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

> Someone get some more food while I try to fix up the engine.
> This engine's incredibly solid. If we manage to salvage it and get a new chassis, this baby keep on doing wonders.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

> We're on it.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 03:58 PM)_

> I'll get a steady fire going to cook stuff...

_Chomsky finds a dead log and torches it, creating a large, yet manageable burn._

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 03:56 PM)_

> Is this camp? Sure it is.

_Sanya drops Emmett off next to Chomsky, and in front of the burning log._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 03:59 PM)_

> I'll see if I can find a weapon...

_Garrick digs in his pockets and pulls out a ring. Putting on the ring particlizes a spear within his hands._

> Oh shoot! The Ring of the Spear King! That's perfect!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 03:59 PM)_

> Use Kyle's body to help repair the ship Jim, he's good scrap.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

_Chomsky watches Garrick's spear appear from nowhere._

> Woah, how did that spear appear there?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

_Emmett gets on his backhooves and feels his biceps tense._

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

t!8ball Is there grass sustainable for Emmett nearby?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, MultiTheDuck.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:00 PM)_

> Shit. That's what was happening...

_Emmett trudges from the makeshift camp, his eyes temporarily blinded due to the sun._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

t!8ball Is there a Floran civilization nearby?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, PlasmaPerson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

t!8ball Is there an otter civilization next to the river that Seth is at with only females?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

t!8ball Is there a communist otter civilization on this planet?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, TheBlade.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:03 PM)_

> I think...

_Emmett trembles._

> ...This is an okay place to Crave.

_Before he loses his grip, Emmett grabs some of the dead grass around him and tries to chew it. He immediately spits it out._

> Fuck...

_Emmett drops to the ground and his body flops uncontrollably._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:05 PM)_

_Garrick returns with a cervine corpse with three spears lodged in its torso._

> Hey, I killed something-

_Garrick is disturbed by Emmett's covulsions._

> What's going on?

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

_Chomsky doesn't pay Emmett much attention._

> Well, me and you happen to be the only ones concerned with food, so help me skin the animals to cook.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:06 PM)_

> Alright.

_Garrick drops the animal corpse to the ground and takes out the spears from it. The spears merge into one another, an effect caused by his ring._

> Hopefully these guys are edible.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

> I'm sure it's fine.

_Chomsky takes out a pocket knife and starts to cut into the cervine corpse, still paying Emmett no attention._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

> Emmett slobbers at the mouth profusely and tries to pick himself up, but he's only able to after a bit of struggling.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

t!8ball Are Garrick and Chommsky done skinning the animal quickly?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, RPretribution.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:07 PM)_

_Chomsky portions out the cervine meat into to sections the skewers them. He lies the skewer over the fire, propping it up on some rocks._

> Food, everyone!
> We actually got food for everyone.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

_Garrick speaks into his comms._

> Guys, Chonky's cooking dinner.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> More like "cocking" dinner.

_Jim laughs loudly at his stupid joke._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

_A bulky Emmett crawls to Chomsky and Garrick, his mouth frothing and teeth mashing._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> Stop calling me Chonky!

_Chomsky finally notices Emmett and jumps from his seat._

> Uh oh! Guys, Emmett's doing his thing again!

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:08 PM)_

> Alright I think I'm about done with the patchwork...

_Jim looks around the ship wreckage and sees no one else._

> Did you guys head out to see if there are some people out there?

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> OH GOD EMMETT'S COMING!

_Garrick holds his ring to Emmett in fear, however no spears come out of it. It beeps a bit, signifying that it was recharging._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:09 PM)_

> GHOST MAN!

_Emmett props himself on his hooves, putting himself up on all fours._

> GRASS... NEED...

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

> Emmett, we're trying to make dinner... It seems like you didn't find any grass?

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

t!8ball Does hector start looking for suitable grass for Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:10 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, MultiTheDuck.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Emmett immediately headbutts into the animal over the fire, the top of his head in a firey blaze._

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Sanya looks behind her to see Emmett ruining dinner._

> Emmett!

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 04:11 PM)_

_Deyner, unfazed by the others, continues to work on his bomb gun, having rescued his tools and resources from the wreckage._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

_Emmett acts like an overly aggressive ram, headbutting into things left and right. He manages to extinguish the flames on his head as he misses headbuttong at Chomsky._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

> HEY! I'M COOKING HERE!

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:12 PM)_

_Emmett snarls and balls up his fists._

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya shove her flower into Emmett's snout?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

> Good bye, have fun with Emmett.

_Seth leaves them, following the river while they dealt with beast Emmett._

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

_Deyner looks up from his work and heads to the camp, overhearing the chaos._

> Hello guys!

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

> What the hell, Emmett?

_Chomsky blasts his flamethrower at Emmett._

t!roll d20

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20... Rolled an 8, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

_Emmett squeals and backs up from the flamethrower, extinguishing himself. He tries to grab at the flamethrower, lunging at it._

> DEYNER!

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:14 PM)_

_Jim frowns, overhearing Emmett's primitive speech._

> Oh god not again...

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

> You're not getting this, Emmett!

_Chomsky swipes at Emmett's face to knock him back from his flamethrower._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth find a dryad?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

> Woah, what's wrong with you, Emmett?

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

> I'll try to calm down Emmett...

_Garrick attempts to possess Emmett, entering into his body._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

_While he's able to possess the squoatling, Garrick can barely keep his hold given how unstable The Crave has made Emmett._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

_Emmett howls as Garrick enters his body and manages to ram Deyner square in the torso before losing control over himself._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

t!8ball Do communist otters start popping out of the woods due to the noise and fire?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, TheBlade.

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

_Hector panics, looking for grass to satiate Emmett._

> What type of grass does he need?!

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:16 PM)_

> Jeez, I forgot how tiring this was...

_Garrick manages to keep Emmett in check by restricting his limbs, however he's still able to erratically move them on occasion._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Seth enters a grove hidden behind vines and rocks._

> Hello?

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:17 PM)_

_Emmett howls under Garrick's control, and his movements become more controlled. Garrick is struggling to keep his dominion over his body!_

> I don't know, just get a bunch of grass before I lose control of him!

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Deyner is knocked out from the sudden headbutting._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_`Dryad`: A dryad appears in front of Seth, giving him a rather promiscuous smile._

> `Dryad`: Hello, newcomer.

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

_Hector grabs many varying types of grass from several different patches._

> I hope this is enough!

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner wake up and attack Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Ask again later, Deyner.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

> If you're losing control, something tie him down and find some damn grass!

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:19 PM)_

_Garrick sluggishly stomps in Emmett's body over to where Hector is, his movements frequently stopped by Emmett trying to pull against him. It's noticeable how weak the possession tactic is turning out to be._

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

t!8ball Does hector return with the right kind of grass

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:20 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, MultiTheDuck.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Garrick screams in Emmett's voice._

> SOMEONE... TIE... EMMETT... DOWN!

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

> I can knock him out if we need!

_Hector looks for his knockout gas in his pack, grass still in hand._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:21 PM)_

_Garrick barely manages to hold Emmett still._

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

_Hector finds his knockout gas canister and decides to drop the bundle of grass, taking out his rifle._

> I could try and inject him to knock him out!

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

> EMMETT... IS LITERALLY... THE INCREDIBLE... BULK...!

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

_Seth smirks, gazing up and down the Dryad's tall and slender body._

> I'm guessing you're a dryad?

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:22 PM)_

> SQUOAT SMASH!

_Emmett punches himself in the face, regaining control over himself._

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> Oh god!

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya try to calm Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Brakia.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_Garrick loses control and flies out of Emmett from the punch._

> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

_Sanya folds her arms and just watches as Emmett continues to cause trouble for the others._

> I'm not even going to try and help out.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:23 PM)_

> Oh holy mother of Joseph on a unicycle....

_Jim drops his tools and runs to the camp to try and assist the others._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> `Dryad`: Of course, hun.
> `Dryad`: What else did you expect to find on this planet?

_`Dryad`: The dryad gives Seth a sly wink._

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 04:24 PM)_

> Okay everyone move back, I'm going to try and knock him out!

_Hector loads knockout gas into all three chambers of his rifle and takes aim._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> He's spasming, Hector!

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

_Emmett pretends to have a spasm and falls to the ground, acting unconscious._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:25 PM)_

> Well, some animals, maybe a nice little civilizations of elves, or something of the sort.

_Seth wiggles his eyebrows._

**WatchfulDrake** _(30-Sep-18 04:26 PM)_

> Is my stuff leaking?

_Confused, Hector takes a moment to check his chemicals._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:27 PM)_

> But definitely not a dryad, considering how rare they are across the GU...

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

t!8ball Does Deyner wake up?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:28 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Deyner.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

_One of Emmett's horns crack a little from all the headbutting._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:29 PM)_

_Chomsky watches, expecting Emmett to hop back up quickly._

> Uh oh. Better hurry up with that grass while he's down.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett fall asleep?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Deyner** _(30-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

_Deyner takes advantage of the sleeping Emmett and takes out his hammer and makes two fell swoops on his body with it._

> This is what you get for knocking me out!

t!roll 2d15

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a 2d15... Rolled a 5 and a 2, making 7, Deyner.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:30 PM)_

_Garrick snatches Deyner's hammer, mortified by his actions._

> What the hell?!
> EMMETT'S ASLEEP
> E-MET'S A-SLEEP!

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

> Alright, I think he is out for good...
> Someone get the rope.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:31 PM)_

_From his exhaustion and malnourishment, Emmett ends up actually falling asleep, despite the head trauma Deyner attempted to give him._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

> `Dryad`: Well luckily we're below GU jurisdiction, if you catch my drift...

_`Dryad`: The dryad drops her leafy clothes, showing her body off to Seth like a dream come true._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:32 PM)_

> Wow, you're straight to the point, huh!

_Seth strips naked and hugs the Dryad, kissing her neck._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

t!choose marshmallow | one of emmetts squoat books

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:34 PM)_

ðŸ¤” | RPretribution, I pick marshmallow!

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

> GUYS, I FOUND ANOTHER MARSHMALLOW!

_Garrick champions it around._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

> I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAVE SO MANY

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth have sex with the dryad?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick also find rope in his pockets?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, TheBlade.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

_Garrick feeds Emmett the marshmallow before taking out some rope._

> Convenient.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

_Chomsky scoffs and puts the sliced cervine meat on the fire once more._

> Dude, stop stashing marshmallows you dont even eat.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:35 PM)_

_Jim reaches out to Garrick._

> Garick, pass me that rope over there.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:36 PM)_

_Despite being pacified momentarily, Emmett's body still deteriorates from being without his grass and in The Crave._

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:36 PM)_

_Garrick throws the rope to Jim._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:36 PM)_

_Jim ties up Emmett, making sure to bind him tightly given his previous experience with The Crave._

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

t!8ball Does the magic marshmallow Garrick fed him keep Emmett intact for the time being?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, PlasmaPerson.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett wake up and start chewing the marshmallow, pacifying him temporarily?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, RPretribution.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

> I told you these marshmallows would come in handy...

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:37 PM)_

_Emmett briefly opens his eyes to see Garrick staring at him with a smile. He chews on the marshmallow and speaks with a full mouth._

> Squemfet sleepy...
> Squemfet just wants to sleep...
> Ghost Man put mallow in mouth...

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick have the good grass in his pocket?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:39 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, PlasmaPerson.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

_Garrick pets Emmett's head._

> Goodnight, Squemmy.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth finish up and find out the dryad in reality was a drow assassin?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

_Emmett sticks out his tongue in disgust at Garrick. "Squemmy" was more of a romantic pet name in Squoatopian culture anyway._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

t!8ball Does the dryad pull grass out the ground while getting fucked by seth?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:40 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Reply hazy try again, TheBlade.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

_`Drow Assassin`: After Seth climaxes inside of her, she grabs a poison dagger from the ground and holds it up to Seth's neck._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

_Seth gives the Drow assassin a disgusted look and backs up from her._

> Not nice.
> I just came in you. Give me a second before trying to kill me, jeez'.

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

t!8ball Does the dryad pull grass out the ground while being fucked by seth?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, TheBlade.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:41 PM)_

_Garrick blows a raspberry at Emmett in rebuttal._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:42 PM)_

_Emmett sighs and tries to relax in the bindings._

> Ghost Man make Squemfet angry.
> But Squemfet is... empty.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:42 PM)_

_Chomsky grins and mocks Emmett's primative speak._

> Filly with angee...

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:42 PM)_

_Emmett sniffles._

> And sad.

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:42 PM)_

_Garrick laughs._

> Squemfet is filly with angee.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:43 PM)_

_Chomsky rotates the sliced meat on the fire and eyeballs Sanya._

> Sanya, more like... Santa.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:43 PM)_

> `Drow Assassin`: Come on Seth, just let it happen, this is what happens when you kill someone's dad.

_`Drow Assassin`: The assassin follows him with the knife._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:43 PM)_

_Seth continues to back up from the assassin._

> Dindu nuffin!

**RPretribution** _(30-Sep-18 04:44 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick help Chomsky with cooking?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:44 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, RPretribution.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 04:44 PM)_

_Sanya rolls her eyes._

> Chomsky more like, uh... dead parents.

**PlasmaPerson** _(30-Sep-18 04:44 PM)_

_Chomsky scowls._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:45 PM)_

_Emmett's body loosens up, but his body continues to deteriorate without his fixing of grass._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:45 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth shoot the drow assassin in the knees and run away naked with his laser pistol in hand, his holster covering his penis, and his other hand carrying the grass the assassin pulled?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:45 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(30-Sep-18 04:46 PM)_

_Sanya looks out in the distance and sees a towering elf run naked towards them?_

> Is that Seth?

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:46 PM)_

_Seth makes it back to them, his holster barely covering his genitals._

> SCARY WOMAN TRY TO KILL ME!

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth Stuff his dirty hand into Emmets mouth full of grass?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, TheBlade.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

> SO I SHOOT HER IN KNEE!

_Seth reaches down with the grass into Emmett's mouth._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

_Emmett manages to bite Seth's hand in his sleep, causing him to recoil and his hand to have deep bite marks._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:47 PM)_

> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! FUCK, EMMETT!

_Seth angrily flips Emmett over and pulls down his sweatpants._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth give Emmett the grass anally?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:49 PM)_

> THIS IS WHAT YOU GET FOR BITING ME!

_Seth jams his fist full of grass into Emmett's ass and pulls back up his pants for him._

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

_The sudden fisting causes Emmett to wake up immediately, his eyes practically bulging out of his head. He's no longer in The Crave, that's for sure._

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

> FIXED EMMETT, NOW WE LEAVE!

_Seth marches back to the wreckage._

**TheBlade** _(30-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

t!8ball Do the ship's main functions, like emergency servies, turn on?

**Tatsumaki** _(30-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, TheBlade.

**Bagelwrecker** _(30-Sep-18 04:50 PM)_

> WE GO TO SHIP CRASH NOW AND SLEEP!

**Zander** _(30-Sep-18 04:51 PM)_

_Emmett winces in pain, his ass aching him._

> SETH, WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO ME?!
