_The Polonot exits the wormhole, it hurling towards a planet due to Hector's random piloting._

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:11 PM)_

_It just so happens that Matthias was transported to Hector's ship, having swapped places with Hector! And of course, the lovable scamp Seth decided to shoot down the ship amidst the chaos._

_Emmett attempts to stand, his legs causing him agonizing pain. He leans on a wall, holding his right leg._

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:18 PM)_

t!8ball Does hector go around treating everyone's wounds restoring their health?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:18 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, WatchfulDrake.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:19 PM)_

> That's O'nasera...

_Seth looks around the forest they landed in, trying to determine whether this was his home planet, Lama'entria._

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:19 PM)_

t!roll d30

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:19 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d30... Rolled a 25, WatchfulDrake.

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:19 PM)_

_Hector does his best to help the other crewmembers, using an array of syringes, medication, and tools to fix them up. He fits Emmett up with some splints, bandages up Matieu's beaks and arms, and overall gets the crew in a stable state._

**Brakia** _(26-Aug-18 04:19 PM)_

_Sanya feels her patched-up cheek._

> Thanksss...

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:19 PM)_

_As Hector is helping Emmett stand with his splints, Emmett looks over to him._

> You're a doctor?

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:20 PM)_

> Now if you excuse me, I got things to do, thank you for the healing.

_Seth smiles deviously and leaves the ship wreckage._

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:20 PM)_

> You could say...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 04:21 PM)_

_Matieu sighs in relief, his arms back to a semi-normal state, albeit needing to be stretched out akin to Emmett's splints for the medication to do its work._

> Thanks Hector.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:22 PM)_

> Licensed?

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:22 PM)_

> Yes?

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:22 PM)_

> Nice...

_Emmett wobbles a bit, having to get used to his tense legs._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 04:23 PM)_

> I'm his right hand.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:23 PM)_

_Emmett gives the short avian a soft smile._

> Right hand? So you're a nurse then.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 04:24 PM)_

> You could say.

t!8ball Does Matieu show off his INTENSE NURSESHIP by cutting open Emmett's artery and sealing it back together in a couple of seconds?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:25 PM)_

🎱 | It is certain, Enchantingtable2013.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:25 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth don his Starfleet captain uniform and exit the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:25 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:26 PM)_

_Emmett feels his neck in pain after Matieu's stunt, immediately souring his opinion of the unprofessional nurse._

> I would have fucked you up so hard if that wasn't an artery.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 04:26 PM)_

_Matieu is taken aback by Emmett's brashness, but reverts to a friendly state._

> See? It hurts, but I won't let you die.
> Now rate my practice on a 1 to 10, be honest!

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:27 PM)_

_Hector looks in horror at Matieu._

> Dear god Matieu, at least let me knock them out first!

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:27 PM)_

_Emmett furrows his brow and shakes moreso than before due to his body needlessly losing more blood._

> A 1, as you nearly killed me for no reason.
> Sheesh...

_Emmett backs up from Matieu, understandably pissed at him._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 04:28 PM)_

_Matieu scowls from the low rating._

> Once more, I wouldn't let you die!
> Nor would Hector.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:28 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett make as much space between him and Matieu as possible before exiting the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:28 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, definitely, Zander.

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:28 PM)_

_Hector frowns, apologizing for his nurse._

> I'm sorry about that.... sir?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 04:29 PM)_

_Matieu looks away, folds his arms and scoffs from Emmett's reaction._

> Jeez', he's one of those. They take it for granted until the day they need it the most.

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:30 PM)_

_Hector rolls his eyes._

> You did step out of line, you know if we're gonna do something like that to knock them out first.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:31 PM)_

_Having figured that the planet was in fact his home planet, Seth smiles and points at a kingdom in the distance._

> You wanna go see my ship collection?

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:32 PM)_

_Trying to ignore Matieu's crime against him, Emmett catches up to Seth._

> You have a ship collection?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 04:32 PM)_

_Matieu looks at the floor._

> Sorry, Hector...

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:32 PM)_

> I got a bunch from captured pirates and many from before.

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:32 PM)_

t!8ball Do Hector and Matieu try and catch up with the others?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:32 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, WatchfulDrake.

**Brakia** _(26-Aug-18 04:32 PM)_

> You guysss go on. I'll find sssomething to do...

_Sanya stands from the wreckage of the ship and heads in a different direction than the others._

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:32 PM)_

> Thankfully military law lets us keep looted goods as long as we pay for 25% of the value.

_Seth smirks._

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:33 PM)_

_Hector pats Matieu on the back._

> It's fine, he's still alive, that's a plus.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:33 PM)_

> Sure...

_Emmett frowns slightly._

> What happened to my girlfriend?

**Brakia** _(26-Aug-18 04:33 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya find someone to stab?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:33 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:33 PM)_

_Seth thinks of an excuse for a bit before giving Emmett a response._

> During the scuffle between us I sat upon the airlock remote.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:33 PM)_

_Emmett is taken aback, his eyes widening from this news._

> What the fuck, man?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 04:34 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu start talking to Hector about how strange the others are?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:34 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, Enchantingtable2013.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:34 PM)_

> Look, you threw me and I landed on the remote.

_Seth shrugs, his smug look dropping for his son._

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:34 PM)_

> I vaguely remember you being tossed to the restroom...

_Emmett feels his head, as if trying to remember what happened the day prior._

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:35 PM)_

> I kinda kicked down the door to give you a cigarette.

t!8ball Does Seth calm Emmett down?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:37 PM)_

🎱 | Signs point to yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:37 PM)_

_Seth frowns, legitimately feeling guilty about airlocking Emmett's girlfriend._

> I'm sorry Emmett, I hate that I airlocked her.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:39 PM)_

_Emmett shakes his head and sighs, his frown slowly disappearing._

> Dude, she was my world...
> Well, not really.

_Emmett shrugs, having effectively forgiven Seth already._

> She kinda was too happy for me.
> That brain damage really killed the mood for me...

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:40 PM)_

_Seth gives a sigh of relief and looks onto the horizon at the kingdom once more._

> Plenty of space fish in the galaxy.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:40 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett see a huge castle in the distance?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:40 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:40 PM)_

_Seth pinpoints one of the many castles in the kingdom. It appears that Elven nobles get castles of their own, albeit smaller than the king's._

> Ah, my father's castle.

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:41 PM)_

_Hector appears from behind the two._

> Reminds me of the time I spent serving the Martian kings.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:42 PM)_

_Emmett turns to Hector._

> Mars? Like that planet that is around Earth?

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:43 PM)_

> Yes, havn't been been there in a long time, but yes.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:43 PM)_

> Well, let's call a taxi.

_Seth starts tapping on his watch._

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:44 PM)_

> Don't you guys still use...

_Emmett thinks for a moment on what Seth called the transportation animals on this planet._

> "Horses", or something?

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:45 PM)_

t!8ball does Hector check his medical supplies while everyone is waiting for a taxi?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:45 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, WatchfulDrake.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:46 PM)_

> We mostly do.
> We try to keep the planet clean.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 04:46 PM)_

t!8ball Does Matieu ask Hector to have his Stimgun back?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:46 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, Enchantingtable2013.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:46 PM)_

> I'll have the police solve the whole crashed ship thing...

_Seth takes out his holodevice and taps away on that as well, contacting everyone he knew._

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:47 PM)_

> Is that really their jurisdiction?

**Brakia** _(26-Aug-18 04:47 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya find more people to kill?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:47 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:48 PM)_

_Seth shrugs._

> I mean it crashed on my dad's land technically.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:48 PM)_

_Emmett looks around for his buddy, having not paid her any mind when she mentioned she was going to leave._

> Hey, where's Sanya?

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:48 PM)_

> Who?

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:49 PM)_

> The plant woman.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:49 PM)_

_Seth groans and looks around with Emmett for Sanya._

> Shit, I don't need her stabbing people and getting arrested.

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:49 PM)_

> Oh, I thought I made them up while delirious from the wormhole...

_Hector hits his head a bit in case he was dreaming._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 04:50 PM)_

_Matieu snaps rudely in Hector's face._

> Hey Hector, the stimgun.
> Kind of hard to be a combat medic without it.

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:50 PM)_

> Here, I think we will need it soon.

_Hector takes out Matieu's stimgun from his pack._

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:51 PM)_

_Emmett starts feeling a twinge from his hormones running rampant the day prior._

> You think there's any...

_Emmett coughs intentionally._

> Women for me here?

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:52 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya get arrested?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:52 PM)_

🎱 | My reply is no, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:52 PM)_

_As Seth ignores him, Emmett rolls his eyes and repeats himself._

> Seth?

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:52 PM)_

> What's up?

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:52 PM)_

> You think there's any...

_Emmett coughs intentionally._

> Women for me here?

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:53 PM)_

> We might have to go deeper into the forest...

_Seth looks into the forest, not really wanting to head in there at the moment._

> Unless you're fine with your partner being one to two feet taller than you.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:53 PM)_

_Emmett has an irked expression._

> I'm not really into elves, no offense.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 04:54 PM)_

> Not a problem.
> We'll go deeper into the forest then after we visit my family.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:54 PM)_

t!8ball Do Emmett and Seth slow down a bit so that Hector and Matieu may catch up?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:54 PM)_

🎱 | Signs point to yes, Zander.

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:55 PM)_

_Hector pants a bit, exhausted from so much commotion in such a short time._

> Thank you for waiting.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 04:56 PM)_

> Yeah thanks.

_Matieu tries to think of an apology for Emmett, tapping his shoulder._

> And sorry about cutting open your artery, I should've put you asleep first...

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:56 PM)_

_Emmett scoffs and holds his neck, pulling away from Matieu._

> You really shouldn't touch me unless I'm hurt. Or at all.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 04:56 PM)_

_Matieu takes a deep breath._

> That's pretty rude of you.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 04:56 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes and submits._

> But it's fine, I guess.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 04:57 PM)_

> I was just excited, me and Hector are usually alone.

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 04:57 PM)_

t!8ball Does the group hear the screams of one of Sanya's victims?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:57 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook not so good, WatchfulDrake.

**Brakia** _(26-Aug-18 04:58 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya kill some more random people?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 04:58 PM)_

🎱 | Signs point to yes, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 05:02 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya get arrested now?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:02 PM)_

🎱 | You may rely on it, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(26-Aug-18 05:03 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya stab the police?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:03 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(26-Aug-18 05:03 PM)_

_Through handcuffs, Sanya still manages to kill the police apprehending her. She's been killing elves to keep her mind off of the crash and Seth's piloting idiocy._

> Get Ssstabbed!

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 05:03 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett's stomach rumble?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:03 PM)_

🎱 | It is certain, Zander.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 05:03 PM)_

_Trying desperately not to think about a potential partner, Emmett feels his stomach grumble._

> I'm kinda' hungry man.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 05:04 PM)_

> We'll get some food once we get there, we're almost there...

_Seth hops onto a log to get a good view of the kingdom gates up ahead._

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 05:04 PM)_

> Is there a town near here where we could get something to eat?

_Hector digests Seth's response a bit late._

> That works.

t!8ball Does the group arrive at the castle?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:04 PM)_

🎱 | Ask again later, WatchfulDrake.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 05:04 PM)_

> So, what's your guys' names? I never got them.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 05:04 PM)_

t!8ball Do they stab her back?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:04 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, Bagelwrecker.

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 05:05 PM)_

_Hector holds out two of his four hands._

> My name is Hector.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 05:05 PM)_

t!roll d20

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:05 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d20... Rolled a 14, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 05:05 PM)_

_`Elven Police`: The stabbed policemen call for backup, which comes quickly with swords. They manage to stab Sanya in return, slicing her leaves on her head and her chest._

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 05:05 PM)_

t!8ball Does the group arrive at the castle?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:05 PM)_

🎱 | Don't count on it, WatchfulDrake.

**Brakia** _(26-Aug-18 05:05 PM)_

> I'm gonna ssstab your parentsss!

_Sanya attacks in return in a small rage._

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 05:07 PM)_

`Sanya`: t!roll d10

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:07 PM)_

🎱 | Rolling a d20... Rolled a 9, Zander.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 05:07 PM)_

_`Sanya`: Manages to stab nine of the ten policemen in return, decapitating some, impaling others, and leaving others to bleed out in terror. Despite having joined the Vortox Pummelers and leaving her assassin-for-hire profession behind, Sanya is still a well-oiled murder machine._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 05:07 PM)_

> Mine is Matieu.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 05:07 PM)_

_Emmett awkwardly shakes both of Hector's hands._

> Well, nice to meet you, Matieu and Hector.

t!8ball Is the bunch, minus Sanya, now at the castle?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:07 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, Zander.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 05:08 PM)_

_Matieu looks about him at the regalia in the gardens, not used to this kind of environment._

> This is cool...

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 05:09 PM)_

> Well, lets go inside.

_Seth opens the front door to the castle for the group._

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 05:09 PM)_

> So your parents live here?

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 05:09 PM)_

> If you have any coats leave them with Jeeves...

_Seth closes the door behind them._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(26-Aug-18 05:09 PM)_

> Good thing I don't have any.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 05:09 PM)_

_Emmett smiles softly, the golden highlights in the atrium reminding him of Tawfeek Manor._

> Jeeves is all-knowing...

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 05:11 PM)_

_Hector raises an eyebrow._

> Who is Jeeves?

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 05:11 PM)_

_Emmett shrugs._

> I don't know. Seth talks about him from time to time.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 05:11 PM)_

_Seth scoffs, offended by Hector's inquiry._

> The butler.

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 05:11 PM)_

> Nice.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 05:11 PM)_

_Seth glares at Hector._

> Don't break Space Rule 316 again though.

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 05:12 PM)_

> Oh.

t!8ball Does the group continue into the castle?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:13 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, WatchfulDrake.

**Brakia** _(26-Aug-18 05:13 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya kill the guards and resists her arrest?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:13 PM)_

🎱 | It is certain, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(26-Aug-18 05:13 PM)_

_Sanya holds out a thumbs up and flips it down at the kingdom after having killed all of the guards sent for her._

> Your parents are next!

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 05:14 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya get arrested again?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:14 PM)_

🎱 | My reply is no, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 05:15 PM)_

> Hmmm...

t!8ball Does Emmett snatch a fruit from a barrel while no one is looking?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:15 PM)_

🎱 | My sources say no, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 05:15 PM)_

_Seth watches Emmett grab a green, sour, hourglass-shaped fruit from a barrel and bite into it. He facepalms from his son's lack of civility._

> Tsk, Emmett.
> You coulda' just asked and told them I'm the son of the duke.

**Zander** _(26-Aug-18 05:15 PM)_

_Emmett stares at Seth with a guiltless expression and continues to bite into the fruit._

> I'm starving man. The Crave really takes it out of me.

**WatchfulDrake** _(26-Aug-18 05:18 PM)_

> Ugh, let's not get ourselves in trouble, shall we?

t!8ball Does Hector go to pay for the fruit Emmett stole?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:18 PM)_

🎱 | You may rely on it, WatchfulDrake.

**Brakia** _(26-Aug-18 05:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya stab the guards' parents?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:21 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(26-Aug-18 05:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya now get arrested?

**Tatsumaki** _(26-Aug-18 05:21 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, Bagelwrecker.

🐐 | And so, the cycle of Sanya killing guards and getting arrested repeated until they decided to have a truce. Eventually, Sanya returns back with the others to the ship, where they have set up camp for the night.
