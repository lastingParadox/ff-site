**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does the man Emmett needs to hospitalize latch onto his back?

**Enchantingtable2013** _(21-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

t!8ball Do I wake up with a mark on my hand?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Enchantingtable2013.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

> No space thots up in this here ship!

**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

> `Hospital Guy`: Go to the medic's place.

**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

> Any vehicle?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

> `Grand Elder's Daughter`: I'll get you for this!

**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

**Enchantingtable2013** _(21-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

> We'll fuck later, have a great day.

**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:23 PM)_

_Emmett speaks in a whispered tone, exasperated._

> Fuck me.

**Brakia** _(21-Jun-18 07:24 PM)_

> All the systems check out. I should probably check on Seth.

t!8ball Do I check on Seth?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jun-18 07:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Concentrate and ask again, Brakia64.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:24 PM)_

> Anyways.

**ProfessorTree** _(21-Jun-18 07:24 PM)_

> You want me to kill her before she goes and tells her pops?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:24 PM)_

> Nah.

**ProfessorTree** _(21-Jun-18 07:24 PM)_

> I think I should.

**Brakia** _(21-Jun-18 07:24 PM)_

> What happened in here?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:25 PM)_

> Her vagina was better than most to be honest.
> So I'd keep her alive. Well worth the space crabs.

**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:25 PM)_

_Emmett continues to whisper, putting his communicator to his mouth._

> Turns out her vagina was moist from the space crab nest.

**Brakia** _(21-Jun-18 07:25 PM)_

> That doesn't answer my question.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:27 PM)_

_Seth's eyes oogle out of their eyesockets in a cartoonish way for a second or two._

> Humina humina!

**ProfessorTree** _(21-Jun-18 07:27 PM)_

> He was banging the daughter of our assassination target.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:27 PM)_

> Not an assassination target.

**Brakia** _(21-Jun-18 07:28 PM)_

> Just can't keep it in your pants, can you?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:28 PM)_

> He's the guy we're killing later. But he doesn't have a bounty as far as I know.

**ProfessorTree** _(21-Jun-18 07:28 PM)_

t!8ball Do I chase after the "space thot"?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jun-18 07:28 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Better not tell you now, ProfessorTree.

**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:28 PM)_

> This wasn't in the description of the mission, man.

t!8ball Does Emmett start to tire out about halfway to the medic's station?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jun-18 07:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Better not tell you now, Zander.

**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:29 PM)_

> How far is this place?

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:29 PM)_

> Anyways we got ladies to bone and not a lot of time.

**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:30 PM)_

> `Hospital Guy`: As far as you want it to be, cattle.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:30 PM)_

> Let's get this bodyguard mission over with.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(21-Jun-18 07:30 PM)_

> What's this mark?

**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:30 PM)_

> You're bleeding on my fur now.

**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:30 PM)_

> `Hospital Guy`: Not my fault.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:31 PM)_

t!8ball When I clench my fist, does the mark light up?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jun-18 07:32 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Enchantingtable2013.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:32 PM)_

> Lets pick up some ammo and shit first.
> Mission starts at 1300. It's currently 1100.

**Brakia** _(21-Jun-18 07:33 PM)_

> I'm heading out for better tools.

t!8ball Do I change into my Kimono?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jun-18 07:34 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Brakia64.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:34 PM)_

> We have two hours to buy stuff we need.

**ProfessorTree** _(21-Jun-18 07:34 PM)_

> Those pickles made me tired.

**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:34 PM)_

> You're killing my back.

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:34 PM)_

> Get some lavajuice.
> It'll help.

**ProfessorTree** _(21-Jun-18 07:35 PM)_

t!8ball do I go to my quarters and go to sleep?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jun-18 07:35 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Better not tell you now, ProfessorTree.

**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:35 PM)_

t!8ball Is Emmett starting to tire?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jun-18 07:35 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Zander.

**ProfessorTree** _(21-Jun-18 07:36 PM)_

> Screw fate. I'm taking a nap.

**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:36 PM)_

> Frick.

**Zander** _(21-Jun-18 07:36 PM)_

> `Hospital Guy`: Too immature to say "fuck".

**Bagelwrecker** _(21-Jun-18 07:36 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth use his charisma to buy more bullets at a cheap price?

**Tatsumaki** _(21-Jun-18 07:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Bagelwrecker.
