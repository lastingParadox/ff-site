**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:06 PM)_

> Thisss isss a niccce sssship.

_Sanya walks about the ship, admiring the architecture._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

> Thank you.
> I had to kill a man for it.

_Seth stretches in his lounge chair._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

> It'sss an old model, right?

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

_Jim has already forgotten about Mora-Norap's mission to murder his rival._

> I thought you paid a guy for it?

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:07 PM)_

> Vintage, actually.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:08 PM)_

> Nah, we did a bounty mission for this ship.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya Check all the bedrooms for one that she likes?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Brakia.

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

_Jim watches Sanya walk about the ship, antagonized by her mere presence._

> Wait since when did someone give Sanya the "okay" to just be here?

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

> I did.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

> Sssssincce I got hired...

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

> Kambras, you'll be residing in here.

_Emmett holds the door open to his cabin. Evidently, Emmett wants his room to be quite toasty at night with the two girls in there._

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:09 PM)_

> Still not over the fact that she literally KILLED our last engineer!

_Jim gestures his mind being blown sarcastically._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:10 PM)_

> Considering we lost a crew member through suicide, he'll be replaced by her.

_Seth throws a bottle into the cellroom to Jim's dismay._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:10 PM)_

> I don't know jack about engineering...

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:10 PM)_

_Jim scoffs, annoyed._

> ... As they prove my point..

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:11 PM)_

> I like thisss room.

_Sanya looks into a room that just so happened to be unoccupied. Strange._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:11 PM)_

> Meh, Emmett knows enough.
> Emmett learned enough from me and our last two engineers.

_Seth yawns._

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

_Jim is still understandably upset about Ibraxas's death given how close he was to him._

> It was the same guy...

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

_Emmett looks back at the lounge, having helped Kambras unpack in his room while Maia was still fast asleep. This tended to be commonplace nowadays, with Maia sleeping for equinoxes on end._

> What are you saying about me?

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

_Jim heads back to the cell to work on it, having taken a break to heal his wounds from Sanya._

> Why do you guys let everyone on this ship?

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth start a party to commerate the crew's new crew member and so he can get some ass?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:12 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:13 PM)_

> Were you guys even the original explorers?

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:13 PM)_

> Yes.
> It started off with Emmett and I...

_Seth hums a bit to himself, before having an idea._

> Y'know, let's have a party to celebrate.

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:14 PM)_

> Well if its a party you want...

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:14 PM)_

> Let's go.

_Seth counts... something, pointing at Jim, Emmett, Sanya, and any other crew members._

> We got 40 people on the ship, Emmett launch now.

_There is not 40 people on the ship._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:15 PM)_

> Off to PartyCity--I mean, Party Planet.

_Emmett heads over to the cockpit and sets the coordinates, having fixed the navs with the part Ibraxas got them, rest his soul._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:15 PM)_

> Hell yeah.
> Now if you don't mind me I got women to fuck.

_Seth lies back in his chair and exercises his pelvis, air humping to get himself pumped for the night._

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does Jim get the cell finished?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:17 PM)_

> This damn cell would be finished if you guys hadn't lost our engineer!

_Jim peers into the cell room, pissed that he wasn't able to get it finished in one go._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:17 PM)_

> A sss-cell huh? for who?

_Sanya seems to have forgotten about their conversation earlier._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett end up landing at the planet yet?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Zander.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:21 PM)_

_Emmett sits back in the pilot's chair, realizing it would take a bit longer to land at Party Planet._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:21 PM)_

> Man, it's been a while since I danced like this...

_Seth starts humping the lounge chair in some sort of perverted dance._

> Emmett, we need to have more parties.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya set up her stuff in her new room?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

t!8ball Does the crew land at a never ending party planet?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Bagelwrecker.

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:23 PM)_

t!8ball Does Jim convince Sanya that the cell is her new room?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, TheBlade.

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:23 PM)_

> I'll get your stuff in your room, Sanya.

_Jim grabs all of Sanya's things and throws them into the cell room._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:23 PM)_

> I already have a room...

_Sanya elbows Jim and grabs her stuff back._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

t!8ball Is the crew on the planet yet?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

> Jesus christ...

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya drop her stuff in the room she's claimed?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:24 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

> Okay party people, off the ship now!

_Seth starts to exit the ship._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

_Sanya sits on the bed, still needing to set up her stuff in her room._

> I'm fine. I'll jusssst be here.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris decide to introduce herself to the hosts?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Jelsafan0.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

> Think these guys have some grass?

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

> They may have some of my grass.

_Seth shrugs and grabs some Dots to put in his drink._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:25 PM)_

_Iris curtsies._

> Hello. Might I assume you are the hosts of this party?

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:26 PM)_

> I need it for my brew...

_Emmett notices Iris and tilts his head at her greeting._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:26 PM)_

> You assumed right.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:26 PM)_

> Who are you?

_Sanya looks around the corner, taking an interest in the half-elf._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:27 PM)_

> My name is Iris. It's a nice party.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:27 PM)_

> Don't be rude, my plant-based friend, she's one of the party guests.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:27 PM)_

_Emmett raises his brow, but lowers it in generalization._

> You look like Seth but female.

_Emmett looks away apathetically._

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:27 PM)_

> That won't end well...

_Jim puts down his tools and heads out the ship's hatch, looking around the Party Planet._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:27 PM)_

> I always wanted to do myself.

_Seth clicks his tongue and winks at Iris._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:27 PM)_

> That's some existential shit there...

_Emmett frowns at the thought._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:27 PM)_

_Iris gives Seth a wide-eyed stare, caught by surprise._

> Pardon?

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

> That'sss kinda weird, Sssseth...

_Sanya was still trying to consider the logistics of mammalian mating procedures, not really understanding them._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

> Iris, meet Seth. Seth meet Iris.

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

_Jim gags._

> Don't listen to Seth, he talks with this own dick in his mouth sometimes...

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

_Seth looks over to Emmett pridefully._

> Emmett, can you make me a cocktail?

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

_Iris's concern subsides, and she takes Seth's hand._

> A pleasure to meet you, Seth.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

> I'm Emmett. If you need me, I'll be in the kitchen.

_Emmett heads over to the kitchen to make Seth and himself a cocktail._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:28 PM)_

_Seth bows over and kisses Iris's hand in response. He's being awfully polite right now._

> Pleasure is all mine.

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:29 PM)_

> Wait, why are we heading back into the ship, we are on a PARTY-PLANET!

> Lets have some fun people!

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:29 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth take a seat in a naturally grown couch?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:29 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, definitely, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:29 PM)_

> The planet is literally just a residential frat neighborhood.

_Emmett comes out the ship and joins Seth, handing him his drink._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:29 PM)_

_Garrick exits the ship and immediately pockets a keg before joining the others._

> Heyo.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

> University students. They just like partying when someone hosts.

_Emmett sits on the couch, its texture and softness being surprisingly comfortable._

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

> Why the hell is it called Party Planet then...?

_Jim looks confused, having never gone to college, nor a frat party._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

> Been a while since I've been to a frat party, like maybe... 91 Years.
> Or so.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

_Emmett laughs and elbows Seth in jest._

> Damn, you're old.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

> Naturally grown couchessss? I didn't know that thisss planet wasss sssso eco-friendly. I like it.

_Sanya bounces on one of the couches._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

> I'm not one for loud parties, actually. I'm afraid my friend dragged me here, and then ditched me.

_Iris sits on an opposing couch, shrinking from the music and loud people._

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

> I thought this would be some sort of 24/7 rave shit or something...

_Jim folds his arms, apparently the party not up to his standards._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:30 PM)_

> Don't worry, you can stick around with us. We'll try not to bite.

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

_Jim looks at his uniform, it being tattered from the past few semesters. Regardless, it was still recognizable as a cop uniform._

> Actually now that I think about it, maybe I should change..

_Jim stands up._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

_Some of the college students back away from Jim once they realize he's wearing a cop uniform._

> Jim, go borrow one of my suits, you freaking all the kids out.

_Seth points towards the ship._

**TheBlade** _(18-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

_Jim, to be petty, sits back down._

> Or not.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:31 PM)_

> Thank you very much for your kindness.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

> It's no problem, we elves have to stick together.

_Seth's eyes shine._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

> So, who's the new gal?

_Garrick grabs a pack of naturally grown couch seeds._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

> Well, considering my archidemon half, that normally does not apply to me...

_Iris keeps to herself, uncomfortable._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:32 PM)_

> Ah well, I don't discriminate...

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

_Iris looks at Garrick with a shy smile._

> My name is Iris. A pleasure to meet you.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

> Think I should put some grass in your cocktail, Seth?

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

> Nah.
> I'm not looking to get high right now...

_Seth sips._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

> Yeah, nice to meetcha'. I'm Garrick.

_Garrick takes out a skeletal bone hand slapper from his pocket._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

> SpaceAIDs then...

_Emmett takes out a baggie of a substance he finds sitting around and tosses it to Seth._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:33 PM)_

> Oh, please no.

_Seth pockets the baggie in disgust._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:35 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett brew himself some strong Squoatling-styled vodka?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:35 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Zander.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:35 PM)_

_Emmett attempts to brew a squoatling vodka from a mix of some other drinks and fruits based on what he found on the holonet. However, it just doesn't turn out that strong for him._

> Well, it's not strong...

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:35 PM)_

> Emmett, you trying to bootleg?

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:36 PM)_

> Can I take a sssswig?

_Sanya takes out a mug, not knowing nor caring about squoatlings' extreme tolerance of alcohol._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:36 PM)_

> Would smell like pork otherwise...

_Emmett takes a sip, the drink having a hot, fruity aftertaste from the alcohol content._

> It could potentially knock you out from a glass. Try a sip if you want.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:36 PM)_

> Mind finishing up that cocktail for me? I'm dying of thirst here...

_Seth shakes his cup, having finished up the last cocktail._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:37 PM)_

> I rarely drink, myself...

_Iris holds her arms between her legs._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:37 PM)_

> I'm a floran. I don't have to worry about sssilly thingssss like the effectsss of alcohol.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:37 PM)_

_Emmett takes Seth's cup and fills it up._

> Take this, Seth.

_Emmett hands Seth back the cup, catching a fruity whiff from the drink._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

> Ah, thank you Emmett. You always make the best cocktails.

_Seth drinks, already getting a buzz._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

> Who's this other green lady I haven't met?

_Garrick points a big finger at Sanya._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

> You take after your mother...

_Seth giggles drunkenly._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

> Do I?

_Emmett swishes his cup around, disappointed. He pours a bit of tequila into it and takes a sip and smiles, getting somewhere._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya take a swig of the off-brand squoatling vodka?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Brakia.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

> Your mom was great with making cocktails.

_Seth holds his drink out towards Emmett in honor of his mother._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

> Such talent and creativity...

_Seth shakes his cup, wanting more._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:38 PM)_

_Emmett pours some more for Seth._

> I didn't really know her much...

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:39 PM)_

> Me neither.

_Garrick shrugs and tries a sip of the squoatling-inspired mix. He immediately revolts from it._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:39 PM)_

> Well, I got to know her and your father over the 4 GUYs I protected your family.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:39 PM)_

> That is quite some time...

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:40 PM)_

> I'm gonna go find sssomeone to ssstab. I'll be back.

_Sanya gets up and tosses the drink away, the extreme alcohol content having no effect on her tar blood._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:40 PM)_

> Well, hitchhiking on ships gives you quite a lot of time.

_Seth shrugs and continues to drink._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:40 PM)_

> Interesting.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

> Anyone else want some brew?

_Emmett sticks his face into the keg, enjoying the aroma._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris decide to get something to drink, despite not liking to drink much?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Jelsafan0.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

> How strong is it?

_Seth knees Emmett in the rear playfully as he dips his head into the cocktail, causing him to jump in surprise._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

> Sure.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

> I suppose I'll have some. You only live once, after all.

_Iris grabs some drink from the cocktail mix and tries a sip._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth finish his cocktail?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:41 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Concentrate and ask again, Bagelwrecker.

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

> I literally have nothing to lose...

_Garrick tries the drink again, bearing through the sickening alcohol._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth finish his cocktail?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

> This is like...

_Emmett takes more of a drink._

> A six on the galactic alcohol scale.

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:42 PM)_

> I don't even know what that is.
> To be fair, I don't even know what the normal alcohol scale is.

_Garrick shrugs._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

> This is like a four for the Vortox scale.

_Emmett didn't know the Vortox scale, but based on his experience, he just assumed this would be the case._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

> Right...

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

> So really strong, I'd be careful...

_Seth's face glows bright red._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:43 PM)_

> It couldn't hurt to try it at least once...

_Feeling pressured by Seth's whopping three drinks, Iris is determined to finish at least one._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:44 PM)_

> Of course not, just don't be surprised if you get your socks knocked off.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:44 PM)_

> Noted.

_Iris's mouth burns from the intensity._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> I'm back. No one wanted to be ssstabbed, ssso...

_Sanya comes back, folding her arms in annoyance._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> Emmett has drank gasoline before, so I'm sure he'll be fine.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> Oh. Are we getting the new girl drunk?

_Sanya remains straightfaced, not really understanding the joys of being intoxicated._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> What does gasoline taste like?

_Garrick looks over at Emmett._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:45 PM)_

> I presume so...

_Iris manages to down the drink, definitely not prepared for what was to come._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

> Nothing bad with a little drink now and again Sandyeah.

_Seth smirks, thinking he's clever mispronouncing Sanya's name._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

> It'sss Ssssanya.

_Sanya glares at Seth._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick get a drink?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:46 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, RPretribution.

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:47 PM)_

> Great.

_Garrick, instead of drinking Emmett's highly concentrated mix, grabs a beer and pop open the tab._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:47 PM)_

> That's what I said, Ssssandyeah.

_Seth giggles like a child._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:47 PM)_

> Ssssssssssssstop hissing.

_Garrick chugs the can, getting an entourage of chanting students about him._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:47 PM)_

> Ssscrew you guysss.

_Sanya folds her arms angrily and looks away from the others._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:48 PM)_

> I'm joking around, come and chill with us.

_Seth pats the cushion next to him._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:48 PM)_

_Garrick manages to chug the whole can and looks around at the students. Although he says the following to Sanya, it also applies to the students._

> Hey, don't look at me. Seth did it first.

_Garrick crunches the can on his forehead to the amazement of the students._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:48 PM)_

> We don't get to party every day you know...

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:48 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya sit and have a drink with the crew?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:48 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My reply is no, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:48 PM)_

_Sanya sighs._

> Nah. I'll jussst sssit with you guyss.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:49 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris get super drunk?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:49 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:49 PM)_

_Iris kicks off her heels after having another try at Emmett's mix and tries to touch her toes._

> Wowww... I can't feel my toes! Hahahhahaha!

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:49 PM)_

> Hey, I think the new chick can hold her drinksss.

_Sanya smiles at Iris reassuringly._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:49 PM)_

> I'm gonna go dance, you wanna join me, Iris?

_Seth stands up and holds his hand out to Iris._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

> Are you... gonna be alright?

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

_Iris grabs Seth's hand and the two head over to one of the many dance floors._

> Hahahhaha, sure! Sounds fun to me!

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

_Sanya stares daggers into Seth, thinking his intentions were mmalicious._

> Sssseth, watch yourssself...

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

_Iris is just laughing constantly. Seems she doesn't take alcohol well._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

> I'll be safe...

_Seth winks at Sanya._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

_Sanya scowls._

> I'm not worried about you.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

t!8ball Do Seth and Iris do the boogie woogie?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:50 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:51 PM)_

> Hahahahahaha... hahahhahahhahahhahaha!!

_Iris was heating up, enjoying herself for the time being._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:51 PM)_

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 02:51 PM)_

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:52 PM)_

> Are they... dabbing?

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:52 PM)_

_Garrick chortles._

> What are you two even doing?

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:52 PM)_

_Iris puts her face into her arm and puts her other arm outward. The dab was official._

> Pffftahahhahaha! This is- we are dabbing! Ahahahhahahaha!

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:52 PM)_

_Garrick takes another drink, scoffing in a lighthearted manner._

> Pffft. It's hilarious.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:53 PM)_

> I gotta keep a lady happy...

_Seth starts making some smooth moves on the floor._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:53 PM)_

_Garrick's face contorts into the following face, mminus the nose: ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)_

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

_Seth frowns, seeing Iris breakdown through drunken vision._

> Oh shit, what's wrong Iris?

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

_Garrick's face contorts back into a frown._

> Sheesh...

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

> Oh great, Ssseth made her cry. Niccce job.

_Sanya folds her arms and looks away judgmentally, as if she expected this._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:55 PM)_

_Iris balls, shutting down and getting into a fetal position on the floor._

> M-my daddy doesn't love meeeeeee!!!

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:56 PM)_

_Seth winces when "daddy" is mentioned._

> Oh god.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:56 PM)_

_Sanya grimaces in the cringe._

> Oh no.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:56 PM)_

_Iris starts to cradle herself, still crying vibrantly._

> Aughhhhhh!!!

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:57 PM)_

_Seth sighs and grabs onto Iris, picking her up. The two of them were being posted all over the Party Planet's main social media, much to Seth's chagrin._

> You want me to go beat up your "Daddy"?

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:57 PM)_

_Iris hugs Seth, her face quivering._

> B-but my daddy's an archidemonnnn!

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:57 PM)_

_Seth smiles to try and make Iris feel better._

> No biggy.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:58 PM)_

> But he's my daddy...

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 02:58 PM)_

_Some of the students show off the media posts to Sanya and ask the crew if they wanted to take part in some obvious scams for profit on the site._

> No! No, we're good.

_Sanya waves her hand away at them._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:58 PM)_

> Well, we can make him love you instead.

_Seth raises his brow and smirks._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 02:58 PM)_

_Garrick gags from Seth's flirtacious manner._

> Yeeeahhh... I'm not dealing with someone else's family issues.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 02:58 PM)_

> Whatever, I'll deal with it.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 02:59 PM)_

_Iris, on a switch, smiles brightly at Seth._

> Thank youuuuuu!

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:00 PM)_

> It's no problem, let's keep dancing.

_Seth grabs Iris's hands gently._

> You wanna tango or do the waltz?

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:00 PM)_

> Tango! Let's tango!

_Iris giggles._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:00 PM)_

> Sounds good, I was taught how to tango by my mother.

_Seth and Iris start to tango._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:01 PM)_

> I think her drinking was a bad idea.
> Personally.

_Garrick has a cold expression._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:01 PM)_

> Hehhe, yaaayyy! This is the most fun I've had since I was seven years old!

_Iris laughs vibrantly._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:01 PM)_

> Hey! DJ, change the song to something a little slower.

t!8ball Does the DJ comply?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:02 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:03 PM)_

_Iris starts to slow dance with Seth._

> Oooh, this song is so prettyyyyy...

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:03 PM)_

> The DJ has a good taste in slow music.

_Seth tips his head towards the DJ._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:03 PM)_

> Mmhmm!

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:03 PM)_

_Sanya, as usual, tries to be a party pooper._

> I alwayss dissliked ssslow music.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:04 PM)_

> Well, it's good for slow dancing like this...

_Seth smiles._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:04 PM)_

> Yeah! Super fun!

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:05 PM)_

> I thought I was 80 years too old to dance, but hey, here I am.

_Seth twirls Iris around his hand._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:06 PM)_

> Hehe! Mom always told me not to drink, but it's so much better like this!

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:07 PM)_

_Seth frowns, having remembered how some of the best captains fell due to alcoholism._

> Don't drink all the time though, else you'll end up a homeless vagrant.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:07 PM)_

> How old isss Ssshe? Like, mental age?

_Sanya is trying to get Seth out of trying to court Iris._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:07 PM)_

> Ooookayyyy...

_Iris pauses for a moment, trying to think of an answer to Sanya's question._

> I'm 18!

_Iris smiles brightly._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:08 PM)_

> I hope your dad doesn't get mad with me.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:09 PM)_

> My dad can't get mad. He can't feel anything at all anymore.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:09 PM)_

_Seth looks at her, confused._

> Well, that's both sad and sorta' good I guess?

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:09 PM)_

> Guess so!

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:09 PM)_

> Cool.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:10 PM)_

_Seth checks his watch and looks back to the ship._

> Man, it's getting late.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:10 PM)_

> I guess?

_Iris has no concept of time given the state she's in._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:10 PM)_

> Eh.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:10 PM)_

> I'll be right back, I'm going to go make me another cocktail.

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:10 PM)_

> I just woke up like an hour ago.

_Garrick shrugs._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:10 PM)_

> Ooh! Ooh! Get one for me!

_Iris jumps in excitement, giddy for more alcohol._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:11 PM)_

> Absolutely. Be back in five or so minutes.

_Seth heads back to the ship, which is now flooded with partygoers._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:11 PM)_

> Okie-dokie-loki!

_Iris giggles keeps dancing with herself._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:11 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth make a classic elven cocktail?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:11 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Bagelwrecker.

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:12 PM)_

> I must say, being on other planets is weird.
> Even though I've been with you guys for a while...

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:13 PM)_

> I guess. It's fun, though!

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:13 PM)_

_Seth heads back to the rest of the crew with two glasses in his hand._

> Alright I'm back, I made two elven cocktails.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:13 PM)_

> Ooh, it's been forever since I've had one of those! Pass!

_Iris reaches out for a glass._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:13 PM)_

_Seth hands a glass to Iris._

> Here you go.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:14 PM)_

_Iris practically downs the cocktail._

> Mm, it's so good!

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:14 PM)_

> Well, I used to be a bartender back at my home planet.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:14 PM)_

> Ooh, cool!

_Iris giggles._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:14 PM)_

_Emmett emerges from his room with a cloud girl. He looks a bit guilty, shifting his eyes about the crowd of college students flooding the ship._

> Holy shit...

_Emmmett squeezes through the crowd, meeting up with the others._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:15 PM)_

> Lots of women loved my specialty.

_Seth poses arrogantly._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:15 PM)_

> I used to be a renowned thief back at my home planet.
> Basically the only thing I did for fun.

_Garrick sighs, kind of missing stealing everything with little consequence._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:16 PM)_

> I get my dick a little wet and then I find my house to be crowded with young people...

_Emmett grabs another drink and cracks it open._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:17 PM)_

> I'm sssorry?

_Sanya looks at Emmett in bewilderment._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:17 PM)_

> Which planet are you from, Iris?

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:17 PM)_

> Oh...

_Iris blushes lightly from Emmett's statement._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:17 PM)_

> Oh.

_Garrick remains apathetic despite Emmett's statement._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

> Erm, I'm from... hmmm... we moved a lot, so... I'm not sure?

_Iris holds her head, trying to remember._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

> Sanya, do you even know what mammal biology is?

_Emmett eyeballs Sanya, catching a whiff of her flower._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

> Mmmm.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

> Or do I need to teach you something on the matter?

_Emmett smirks coyly._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:18 PM)_

> Phew, I'm getting a little tired.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:19 PM)_

> I know the quickesst way to kill a mammal.

_Sanya growls lowly, excited from mthe thought._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:19 PM)_

> Then go to sleep.

_Garrick looks at Seth as if he was stupid._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:19 PM)_

> But not much more than that.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:19 PM)_

_Emmett lowers his eyelids, groaning from Sanya's ignorance._

> I'm talking about reproduction and crap.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:19 PM)_

> Shhhhhhhhh, Emmett.

_Seth puts a finger to Emmett's snout._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:19 PM)_

> Yeah, I don't know much about that. Sssorry.

_Sanya looks a bit irked._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:20 PM)_

> Emmett.

_Garrick takes a foam finger out._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:20 PM)_

_Iris finally realizes the time._

> Aw man. I don't have a ride home.

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:20 PM)_

> No.

_Garrick wags his foam finger at Emmett._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:20 PM)_

> I mean, if you were that curious, I could show you something. Completely platonic.

_Emmett smirks, the flower's pheremones finally getting to him._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:20 PM)_

> Ha! I haven't been home in weeks.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:20 PM)_

> Where is your home located? I'll take you home.

_Seth stands from the natural couch, stretching._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:20 PM)_

> Oh! I uh... I actually.... I don't....

_Iris's mouth quivers, a solemmness falling upon her._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

> Are you homeless?

_Seth frowns._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

> I... don't.... remember.

_Iris starts to shake._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

> Shit...

_Seth puts his hand on Iris's back to comfort her._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

> Just get a house somewhere.

_Garrick takes out a little Monopoly-esque plastic house from his pocket._

> Easy.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

> I've been here for a really long time.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

_Sanya looks disgusted._

> I'm not that curiousss.

\*Emmett snaps out of the flower's allure

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

> Emmett, we're going on a scavenger hunt for this woman's home.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett check on his brew while talking to the plant, seeing how it has been severely modified?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:21 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Zander.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:22 PM)_

_Emmett looks around at the college kids who keep on dipping into his keg._

> I need to test this...
> Mostly for safety reasons...

_Emmett takes out a ladle and drinks some of his concoction. He nearly chokes from the unexpected rise in alcohol level. He exhales, his breath feeling much hotter than before._

> Oh crap.
> That's bad.
> Like, 8 or 9 kind-of bad...

_Emmett smiles to himself, realizing this would be a great drink for him back on the ship, but unsafe for the others._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:23 PM)_

> Huh? What's wrong?

_Iris looks over to Emmett woozily._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:23 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya check the drink?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:23 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Brakia.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:24 PM)_

_Sanya shrugs._

> That ssseemsss like your problem.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

> Don't drink this...

_Emmett picks up the brew._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth and Iris go looking for her house?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

> This is coma-worthy...

_Emmmett smells the waft of the strong alcohol._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:25 PM)_

_Despite Emmett's weirdness from before, Sanya takes an interest in what he was saying._

> Coma?

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:26 PM)_

> Can she even go into a coma? She's a plant...

_Garrick considers the logistics of this, sticking the tip of his pinky finger in his mouth._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:26 PM)_

> Like really long period of hibernation.

_Emmett looks at the brew longingly._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:26 PM)_

> Granted, I've only met a few plant people in my life...

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:26 PM)_

> Ahh, I sssee...

_Sanya stands up, ready to head back to the ship._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:26 PM)_

> That doesn't sound good.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:27 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett grab his brew and push his way onto the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:27 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Zander.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:27 PM)_

> Emmett'll be fine drinking it though.

_Seth chuckles and follows Seth back onto the ship._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:27 PM)_

> Out of the way.

_The drink was sloshing about, some drips falling onto the ground._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:28 PM)_

t!8ball Does the brew burn through the ground?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:28 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Brakia.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:31 PM)_

> I'm drinking this...

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:31 PM)_

t!8ball Do Seth and Iris go back to Seth's room?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:31 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:32 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth bring Iris to the hypersleep chamber while Emmett gets wasted?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:32 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Don't count on it, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:32 PM)_

t!8ball Did Iris's home planet blow up?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:32 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | As I see it, yes, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:32 PM)_

_Seth and Iris head to a more quiet room to speak with each other._

> I... I remembered what happened....

_Iris tears up._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:32 PM)_

> Oh yeah...

_In the kitchen of the ship, Emmett drops the brew, preparing himself to down it._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:33 PM)_

> What happened?

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:33 PM)_

> There... was an accident. In the mines...
> It's... gone now...

_Iris starts to choke up, attempting to compose herself._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:33 PM)_

> Time to be Squoat's child.

_Emmett manages to down the whole brew and belches._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:34 PM)_

> Oh damn, that's horrible...

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:34 PM)_

_A drunken Emmett, irritated by the hubble and bubble on the ship, points at the freeloaders and screams at them._

> I AM TELLING YOU ALL TO SHUT THE FUCK UP AND WORSHIP THE ONE AND ONLY SQUOAT!

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:35 PM)_

_Iris, overhearing Emmett while she tells Seth of her past, grimaces._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:35 PM)_

> I remember hearing about that on the news a while back...

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:35 PM)_

_Emmett takes out Seth's laser pistol and points it at the freeloaders._

> I HAVE A GUN FOR ANY NON... uh...

_As some of the partygoers run off the ship in a panic, Emmett drops the gun clumsily._

> Eh, screw you all...

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:35 PM)_

> I'm the only one who made it out in time.

> As far as I know, anyways...

_Iris looks away dismissively._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:36 PM)_

> Oh that sucks.

_Seth mutters to himself._

> Ruined my boner.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:37 PM)_

> I'm getting on the ship.

_Emmett is already on the ship, but it doesn't matter. He's drunk._

> And I am getting a piggyback ride!

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:37 PM)_

> Huh? Piggyback ride?

_Iris perks up, overhearing Emmett's drunken rant._

> Did somebody say piggyback ride??

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:39 PM)_

> What?

_Garrick peers over Emmett, puzzled._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:39 PM)_

> I heard the words piggyback ride.

_Iris smiles, leaving the closet she and Seth were in._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:40 PM)_

_Emmett stumbles over to a random partygoer who still hasn't left the ship._

> Give me a pigg-uhg-piggyback ride.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:40 PM)_

> `Random Partygoer`: Go away creep.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:40 PM)_

_Iris races to the lounge, where she sees Emmett failing at getting a piggyback ride himself._

> Aw man. I thought I was gonna get a piggyback ride...

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:41 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett pull out his crossbow?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:41 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Zander.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:41 PM)_

> Fuck you too.

_Emmett pushes the partygoer aside and makes it to Iris, who was blocking the corridor._

> Move out the way, I need my shit...

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:42 PM)_

> Okay...

_Iris moves aside for Emmett._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:42 PM)_

> Emmett gets angry like this when he drinks heavily.

_Seth pinches his brow, embarrassed that Emmett doesn't "sexy drink" like he does._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:42 PM)_

> Oh, okay...

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:42 PM)_

> Oh, ssso thatsss why he'ss acting weird!

_Sanya relaxes on the lounge sofa, eagerly watching Emmett's drunken stupor._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:43 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett come back out of the captain's quarters with a tribal mask on and his crossbow on his back?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:43 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | My sources say no, Zander.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:44 PM)_

t!8ball Does Naked tribal emmett scare away the party?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:44 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook not so good, Brakia.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:45 PM)_

_Emmett has a tribal mask on that he got from his room. He does NOT get naked, unfortunately._

> If I don't get my piggyback, I am going to start another Vortoxicaust...

_Emmett hocks a loogie into a vase._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:45 PM)_

> A what?

_Sanya's grin subsides._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:45 PM)_

> A Squoaticide.

_Emmett holds onto the wall to balance himself._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:45 PM)_

t!8ball Does that scare Iris enough to give Enmett a piggyback ride?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:45 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Very doubtful, Jelsafan0.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:46 PM)_

> Oh...

_The mentioning of a genocide does not sit well with Iris._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:46 PM)_

_Emmett tries to point at Iris, his aim wavering._

> Half-Seth girl. How do you do it?

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:46 PM)_

> Oh. Isss thiss the affectsss of alcohol?

_Sanya is disgusted from discovering what high levels of intoxication could do to a person._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:46 PM)_

> Do what?

_Iris, although put back by Emmett's behavior, decides to remain polite and respond to him._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:47 PM)_

> It affects people in different ways...

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:47 PM)_

> How are you sso cool?

_Emmett gives Iris an angled smile._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:47 PM)_

> Huh? I'm cool?

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:47 PM)_

> She has some elf in her, that's how she's so cool.

_Seth folds his arms, smiling pridefully._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:49 PM)_

_Emmett tries to roll his eyes, giving a lame attempt at a "shooing" gesture to Seth._

> Elves are dumb.

_Emmett points at Iris, her temperature coincidentally rising._

> I mean, sshe's pretty hot.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:49 PM)_

_Iris tilts her head, her cheeks rosy from the complimments and the alcohol._

> I'm also half archidemon, if that helps?

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:49 PM)_

> I'm a demon, if you get what I mean.

_Emmett gives a weak wink and laughs heartily._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:50 PM)_

> You guysss are going to freak her out.

_Sanya looms over the back of the sofa, scoffing._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:50 PM)_

> Huh? I didn't know you were part demon!

_Through naivety, Iris takes his remark down at different path._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:50 PM)_

> Fuck off, you plant prick. I'm married.

_Emmett raises his right hoof, though no ring was on it._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:50 PM)_

_Seth laughs._

> Always knew Emmett could show off his lady-killing skills, just go along with it Iris.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:51 PM)_

> YE-ah. These horns are those of the Squevil.

_Emmett sticks his digits out and puts them over his horns, playfully headbutting her._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:51 PM)_

> Everyone'sss drunk. Thisss isss jussst great.

_Sanya sighs, attempting to express disapproval. It was clear she was envious._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:52 PM)_

> Get drunk with us, loser.

_Seth throws a beer at Sanya, who catches it._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:52 PM)_

> I'm not sssure I could. I could try...

_Sanya checks the label of the can._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:53 PM)_

_Iris giggles, holding back the Squevil._

> That sounds cool! It's nice to have my half-archidemonic side in common with someone for once!

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:53 PM)_

_Emmmett taps Iris's nose._

> Boop.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:53 PM)_

_Iris backs up a bit, startled._

> Oh!

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:54 PM)_

t!8ball Does Sanya have a drink or two?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:54 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | You may rely on it, Brakia.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:54 PM)_

> But yeah. I'm committed to some universe llama woman...

_Emmett was mixing up Fione and Maia for some reason._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:54 PM)_

t!8ball Does Garrick eat a baby?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:54 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Most likely, RPretribution.

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:54 PM)_

_Garrick grabs one of the student's babies and pretends to eat it, pocketing it._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:54 PM)_

_Sanya had already thrown the can Seth threw at her away._

> Ssscrew it. Sssomeone hand me a drink.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:54 PM)_

_Emmett furrows his brow and points at Garrick, furious._

> GARRICK, STOP EATING THE NEWBORN OF A POOR COLLEGE STUDENT!

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:55 PM)_

_Garrick finishes pocketing the baby and shrugs._

> Okay.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:55 PM)_

_Iris looks at Garrick in a mix of confusion and disgust._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:55 PM)_

_Garrick "shrugs"._

> I don't know??

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:56 PM)_

> Hey Ssseth, can you make me a drink? I heard you were pretty good at it.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:56 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett take off his shirt, having felt hot?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 03:56 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Without a doubt, Zander.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:56 PM)_

> He is!

_Iris notices Emmett and looks away, not wanting to feel embarrassed by being in the presence of his hot bod._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:56 PM)_

> We need to get these kids out.

_Emmett flexes, his muscles weak, though his form oddly impressive._

> The adults need to wrestle.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:57 PM)_

> Maybe... I think I wanna wrestle first.

_Seth smirks at Emmett, knowing he would destroy him in wrestling._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 03:57 PM)_

> I need a drink...

_Sanya acts as if she's dehydrated, pointing to her mmouth._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:57 PM)_

_Emmett looks to Seth and then side-eyes Iris a couple of times, alerting Seth to keep his eye on the prize._

> You're gonna miss your score, headass.

_Emmett looks at Seth goofily._

> Setth.

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 03:58 PM)_

_Iris, of course, did not get Emmmett's hint._

> What's going on?

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 03:58 PM)_

> I'm just gonna. Leave now.

_Feeling embarrassed by the crew hitting on each other, Garrick heads back to his cabin._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 03:58 PM)_

_It takes Seth a moment to understand what Emmett was getting at._

> What's up?

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 03:59 PM)_

> Garrick, go make us some footballs in a bun or whatever.

_Emmett woozily heads over to the couch Sanya is sitting on._

> If I'm going down, I need one of those for my brew.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 04:00 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth make three cocktails?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 04:00 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Bagelwrecker.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 04:00 PM)_

> Here, Sanya.

_Seth gives Sanya one of the cocktails._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 04:00 PM)_

> Hey guys...

> This is where my stash of grass is...

_Emmett reaches underneath the couch and takes out his grass stash._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 04:00 PM)_

> Here you go, Iris.

_Seth gives Iris the next cocktail._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 04:00 PM)_

> Thanksss. Bottomsss up, I guesss...

_Sanya downs the drink, it tingling in her throat. She doesn't feel much from the drink however._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 04:01 PM)_

> Ooh, yay! Cheers, Sanya!

_Iris drinks a bit of her drink, feeling the burn._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 04:01 PM)_

> Right under Sanya's bed...

_Emmett continues to rummage under the couch, mistaking it for Sanya's bed._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 04:02 PM)_

> What'sss under "my bed" now?

_Sanya peers over at Emmett, curious._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 04:02 PM)_

> There's also some of Seth's embarrassing porn magazines that I'm going to show to Iris in a bit...

_Emmett throws out some magazines from beneath the couch._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 04:02 PM)_

> Go ahead.

_Seth sips his drink._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 04:02 PM)_

> That-

_Iris scoffs to her chagrin._

> I-

_Iris drinks nervously._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 04:03 PM)_

> Maybe we'll have the same interests.

_Seth chuckles to ease the tension._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 04:03 PM)_

> They have images of that time you got dommed by that hideous glob princess...

_Emmett looks at the magazine for a bit and changes the page, uncomfortable by seeing Seth's massive rod._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 04:03 PM)_

> What'sss porn? Ssso many mammal cusssstomsss. How am I gonna learn all of thessse?

_Sanya grabs a magazine in curiosity._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 04:04 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett show Sanya the magazine as more people start to leave?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 04:04 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Zander.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 04:04 PM)_

> This is Seth's micropenis...

_Emmett points at Seth's massive penis, purposely trying to antagonize Seth._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 04:04 PM)_

> `Randomm Partygoer`: Doesn't look very micro to me.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 04:04 PM)_

_Sanya smirks, playing along._

> Hm. Are they all that sssmall?

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 04:04 PM)_

> It's "Microsoft".

_Emmett looks at you, the reader as a student plays a "ba-dum-tss" on a drumset._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 04:05 PM)_

_Seth rolls his eyes._

> At least I didn't fuck a goblin.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 04:05 PM)_

> Here is when he got that footlong sub implanted to his weinie...

_Emmett, upon hearing Seth's remark, remembers the traumatizing experience, and starts to puke in disgust and alcohol._

> Fridge me man...

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 04:06 PM)_

_Sanya backs up from Emmett, grossed out by his puking._

> Eww.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 04:07 PM)_

_Seth groans._

> Iris, you wanna head back to my room?

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 04:07 PM)_

_Sitting so close to her, Emmett catches a whiff of her flower's pheremones again._

> Hey Santa?

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 04:07 PM)_

> Huh? What for?

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 04:08 PM)_

_Sanya brushed off the incorrect name._

> Yeah?

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 04:08 PM)_

> Just to get away from the two creeps looking at porn. Unless you want to, I don't mind.

_Seth shrugs, trying to play cool despite his more amorous intentions._

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 04:08 PM)_

> Your petals are showing. Heheh.

_Emmett breathes in, almost hypnotized._

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 04:08 PM)_

> Sounds fun to me!

_Iris follows Seth to his room, not realizing what he intended for them to do in his cabin._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 04:09 PM)_

> I'm blooming! I'm blooming!

_Sanya looks up at her flower excitedly._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 04:10 PM)_

> Hot...

_Seth winks before he and Iris enter his room._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 04:10 PM)_

> Quick, what colors are my petalsss?

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 04:10 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett crawl up the floran's back and sniff the blooming flower?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 04:10 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Zander.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 04:10 PM)_

> You smell like... vanilla...

_The aroma was captivating, with Emmett finally getting his piggyback ride._

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 04:11 PM)_

> What are you doing?

t!8ball Does Sanya get up to look at her petal's colors?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 04:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Signs point to yes, Brakia.

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 04:13 PM)_

> Hey, what'd I miss?

_Garrick leaves his cabin and enters the lounge, watching Emmett rest his chin on Sanya's head._

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 04:13 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth seduce Iris and have sex with her?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 04:13 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(18-Aug-18 04:13 PM)_

> Ooh, they're blood red. Very pretty...

_Sanya was unbothered by Emmett for the time being, more interested in her flowers blooming for the first time this GUY._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 04:13 PM)_

_Garrick raises an eyebrow, thinking Emmett and Sanya were doing something more grotesque._

> ... You're gonna do that right here, in the middle of everyone?

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 04:13 PM)_

_Emmett mutters to Garrick, rubbing his face on Sanya due to the pheremones._

> This flower is the only thing preventing me from feeling like shit...

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 04:14 PM)_

_After Iris and Seth's "bonding session", Seth asks her a question he's never asked anyone in one hundred GUYs, along the lines of "Do you want to be my girlfriend?"._

> I mean, why not?

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 04:14 PM)_

_Iris thinks for a moment, still surprised by what she and Seth just done._

> No...

_Seth frowns and lies back down._

**RPretribution** _(18-Aug-18 04:14 PM)_

> Uh. Alright...
> I can't exactly stop you.

_Garrick shrugs._

> Well, I could.

**Zander** _(18-Aug-18 04:15 PM)_

_Emmett starts to doze off, the alcohol getting to him._

> And I mean, Seth likes to violate my shit anyways...

_Emmett rests his cheek on Sanya's head, who surprisingly let this happen. Maybe it was the alcohol?_

**Jelsafan0** _(18-Aug-18 04:15 PM)_

t!8ball Does Iris fall asleep on Seth's bed?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 04:15 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Outlook good, Jelsafan0.

**Bagelwrecker** _(18-Aug-18 04:16 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth fall asleep?

**Tatsumaki** _(18-Aug-18 04:16 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | It is certain, Bagelwrecker.
