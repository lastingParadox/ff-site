**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:17 PM)_

> Bout' three months... Maybe more.

_Jim yawns._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:17 PM)_

> Our navigation is screwed.

_Emmett taps the console. The course is charted for a cruise liner thousands of AU away._

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:17 PM)_

> Where were we headed, anyway?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:17 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:17 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:18 PM)_

> Ahh, remember our last cruise? Such fun, with the Blobmali Pirates.

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:18 PM)_

> We need to stop if we are going any further.

_Jim butts his head in to the pilot's console, notices the low fuel and gets lightly kicked away by Emmett._

> Fuel is getting low and we are running out of edible food...

_Jim holds his knees and gets away from the pilot's console, having forgotten how protective Emmett was of it._

> ... Someone put three stacks of grass in the fridge...

_Emmett gets up, in the mood to smoke._

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:19 PM)_

_Jim was trying to screw with Emmett._

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:19 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:20 PM)_

_Emmett takes a stack out of the fridge._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:20 PM)_

_Seth sits down and gets comfy, spreading his legs._

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:20 PM)_

t!8ball Does the planet wink at Seth and Emmett?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 05:20 PM)_

🎱 | As I see it, yes, Bagelwrecker.

t!8ball Is the planet a living planet that is in love with the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 05:21 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:21 PM)_

_Emmett overlooks the winking planet and notices buildings with the Llamanian Empire insignia._

> I see a Llamanian presence...

_Emmett frowns._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:21 PM)_

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:21 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett put on the head of the disguise?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 05:23 PM)_

🎱 | My sources say no, Zander.

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:24 PM)_

_Emmett lets the costume hit the floor, the smell being revolting._

> I'm not putting on your shit-filled ape disguise.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:24 PM)_

_Seth heads back to Emmett and screams in his ear._

> K!

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:24 PM)_

_Emmett holds his ears in pain._

> My ears!

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:24 PM)_

> Why did I ever agree to come with you guys...

_Jim shakes his head._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:25 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:25 PM)_

_Seth activates the spacelink and speaks into the microphone._

_The ship starts to land with the instructions sent by the nav crew._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:25 PM)_

> We'll be landing then, lets get a drink later.

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:26 PM)_

> `Coalition Navigation Crew`: We'll need to check your ship out for any forms of... contraband, however, hon'.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:26 PM)_

> I got some contraband you can check right here.

_Seth takes a picture of his beautiful face and sends it over spacelink._

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:26 PM)_

_Ibraxas whispers in a panic._

> Shit, shit, shit, shit!

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:26 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:26 PM)_

> Shieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:27 PM)_

> Damn.

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:27 PM)_

_Emmett runs to his cabin and hides under the covers in his bed._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:28 PM)_

t!8ball Does Seth flash his cock and are the women impressed by how large his penis is?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 05:28 PM)_

_Ibraxas sees Seth's giant cock for the first time and his eyes widen in surprise at its girth and the fact that he stripped naked._

> Jesus CHRIST dude!

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:28 PM)_

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:28 PM)_

t!8ball Are the women half blind?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 05:28 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, TheBlade.

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:28 PM)_

> Why the fuck would you do that?!

_Ibraxas looks away, embarrassed._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:29 PM)_

> Gotta prove it.

_Seth starts gyrating his hips._

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:29 PM)_

> Just put your penis away..

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:29 PM)_

_Emmett shivers._

> Help me...

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:29 PM)_

> Emmett, we might find that dentist here.

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:29 PM)_

_Jim is currently erasing his memory banks of Seth's dick._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:30 PM)_

t!8ball Does Emmett get persuaded from Seth's argument?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 05:30 PM)_

🎱 | Without a doubt, Zander.

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:30 PM)_

> Ok, lets see if we can find a landing spot where we can re-feul

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:30 PM)_

_Emmett sticks his head out the covers, curious about his dead girlfriend who kept invading his dreams in the past month._

> Fine.
> Are the women up front Llamanian?

**Tom Thompson** _(04-Aug-18 05:31 PM)_

> Hohoho, I woke up from my nightmare!

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost exits the Disney Jewel, stretching._

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:31 PM)_

_Jim sighs after hearing the ghost announce its arrival._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:31 PM)_

> They look like they were mixed with goats...

_Seth looks at the sheep people with curiosity, having never seen a normal sheep in his life._

> One was a human though.

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:32 PM)_

_Emmett slips out his bed and looks at the people Seth was talking about._

> Definitely not squoatlings.

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:32 PM)_

> Humans in deep space is a good thing... right?

_The ship's hatch opens up, and the crew is welcomed with open arms._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:32 PM)_

> `Contraband Cop`: Ooh, a cop...

_The contraband rubs herself about Jim, inspecting him, her wool being soft as clouds._

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:32 PM)_

t!8ball Does Ibraxas explore the planet?

> Oh, uh yes? Hi...

_Jim blushes and lets the contraband cop frisk him without even realizing it._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:33 PM)_

_Seth mutters._

> Definitely, but you see how they look like llamas and squoatlings mixed?

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:33 PM)_

_Emmett isn't sure how to feel about this revelation, but speaks based on his hatred of Llamanians._

> That disgusts me if it's true...

**Tom Thompson** _(04-Aug-18 05:33 PM)_

> Is hat a cop? What's going on?

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost picks up the Contraband Cop's hat and inspects it, thinking it was the cop instead of the Ovisaron that wore it._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:33 PM)_

> Don't be a racist, man.

_Evidently, Seth was trying to bone, so he's pushed his abhorrance of llamanians aside._

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:34 PM)_

> Do I have clearance to explore, miss?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:34 PM)_

t!8ball Do they check the ship?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 05:34 PM)_

🎱 | It is decidedly so, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:34 PM)_

> `Contraband Cop`: Let us explore your interior first, human.

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:34 PM)_

> Of course.

**Tom Thompson** _(04-Aug-18 05:35 PM)_

> I have something to sell my soul!

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost pulls out a pinwheel toy and spins it._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:35 PM)_

> `Contraband Cop`: Is that a squoatling?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:35 PM)_

_Seth sweats a bit before slapping Emmett in the back of the head._

> No.
> He's retarded.

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:36 PM)_

_Ibraxas puts aa hand around Emmett as a formm of protection._

> He's wearing a mask.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:36 PM)_

> He's black.

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:36 PM)_

_Emmett rolls his eyes and shrugs Ibraxas off._

> Yeah, I'm a squoatling. Ignore their stupidity.

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:36 PM)_

t!8ball Do the Women believe that its a mask?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 05:36 PM)_

t!8ball Do the Women believe that its a mask?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 05:36 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:36 PM)_

_The cop tilts her head in Emmett's direction._

> `Contraband Cop`: We don't see many of those around these parts.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:36 PM)_

t!8ball Does the Mickey Mouse Ghost scare the women by saying boo?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 05:37 PM)_

🎱 | It is certain, Tom Thompson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:37 PM)_

_The others are afraid of the sudden appearance of the Mickey Mouse Ghost, however the Contraband Cop continues her work, handling Seth's Desert Eagle._

> Handle that Desert Eagle with care please...

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:38 PM)_

> Do I need to give you my arm?

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:38 PM)_

> Cyborg parts are needed for me.

**Tom Thompson** _(04-Aug-18 05:39 PM)_

> Hello ladies...

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost flares its teeth at the welcoming crew, who back away in fear._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:39 PM)_

> `Contraband Cop`: We won't take your arms. Just don't do anything suggestive with them.

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:39 PM)_

> Suggestive?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:39 PM)_

> I'll do something suggestive to you.

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:39 PM)_

_`Contraband Cop`: The contraband cop zips up Seth's pants for him, glaring at him._

> `Contraband Cop`: I'm married.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:39 PM)_

_Seth gives her an absurd stare._

> So what?

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:39 PM)_

> Oh shit!

_Ibraxas was getting excited by the beef between Seth and the cop._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:40 PM)_

> I fucked the president's wife once.

_Seth poses as if this was a great revelation._

**Tom Thompson** _(04-Aug-18 05:40 PM)_

> To who may you be married to?

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost turns around to the cop._

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:40 PM)_

> Which president?

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:40 PM)_

> `Contraband Cop`: Should we be alarmed by the avian here? Not judging.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:40 PM)_

> Malcom Fortheor, Jim.

_Seth looks back at Matthias who was posing like some great figure and rolls his eyes._

> No, he's just tired.

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:41 PM)_

> He's been tired for, like, a year.

**Tom Thompson** _(04-Aug-18 05:41 PM)_

> He is just tired and lieing.

_Seth pumps his fist in the air._

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:41 PM)_

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 05:42 PM)_

**Tom Thompson** _(04-Aug-18 05:42 PM)_

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost is facing the Contraband Cop as it asks this._

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 05:42 PM)_

> It's strange to see someone else like me after all of this time. Even if you're part llama...

**Enchantingtable2013** _(04-Aug-18 05:42 PM)_

_Matthias stretches and sighs, annoyed at the fact that he was in a cryochamber._

> Why the hell do they always freeze me?

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 05:42 PM)_

> Nice. Hopefully they have ship parts.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:42 PM)_

_Seth gives Matthias a slap followed by a side hug._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:43 PM)_

> `Coalition Leader`: We're the effect of a secret alliance between the llamas and goats. Just a few of each put away their differences.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:44 PM)_

_Seth's urges start to take over._

> Is prostitution legal here?

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:44 PM)_

_Seth licks his lips._

**Tom Thompson** _(04-Aug-18 05:45 PM)_

> Emmett, why are we on this planet?

_The Mickey Mouse ghost bounces up and down dramatically, bored._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:46 PM)_

_Seth groans at the ghost's presence._

> Shut up, slave labor.

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:46 PM)_

> We're here because of us traveling in deep space for like an eternity.

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:46 PM)_

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:46 PM)_

**Tom Thompson** _(04-Aug-18 05:47 PM)_

> Seth, shut up before I give a picture of your face to the most ugly man and say you want a blow job!

_The Mickey Mouse Ghost stomps its feet in the air angrily._

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:47 PM)_

_Jim looks at Seth in his peripheral vision._

> He would probably like that...

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:47 PM)_

_Seth puts some swagger in his walk as he heads to the only human woman in the room._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:48 PM)_

_`Coalition Leader`: The Coalition leader squeezes Emmett's tense shoulders tightly before stopping the massage._

**Tom Thompson** _(04-Aug-18 05:48 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:48 PM)_

_`Coalition Human`: The coalition human folds her arms, attempting to act disinterested in spite of Seth's charismatic aroma._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:49 PM)_

> How about that drink we were talking about?

_Seth winks seductively._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 05:49 PM)_

> `Coalition Leader`: This was before and after the alliance here.

**Tom Thompson** _(04-Aug-18 05:49 PM)_

> And I think they are dead!

_The Mickey Mouse ghost has a high-pitched laugh._

> So why not marry someone else?

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 05:49 PM)_

_Jim waves at the crew, heading to a casino named, "Cosino's"._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:49 PM)_

_`Coalition Human`: The female scoffs, though it's clear she's getting flustered by Seth._

_`Ship Mechanic Owner`: The owner looks at Ibraxas as if he was crazy._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 05:54 PM)_

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 06:45 PM)_

🎱 | Yes, Bagelwrecker.

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 06:45 PM)_

_Apparently Ibraxas's fart was so rancid he starts to choke from it. Maybe the poison the assassin slashed him with was finally taking its toll..._

> I can't fucking breathe..

t!8ball Does the floran run into the medbay and do the Heimlich maneuver on Ibraxas?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 06:46 PM)_

🎱 | Outlook good, Zander.

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 06:47 PM)_

_`Floran Assassin`: The floran assassin picks up Ibraxas and tries to puff the fart out of his lungs, I guess. (As I write this, I realize how disgustingly embarrassing this episode is.)_

> `Floran Assassin`: I only get the money if I kill you!

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 06:47 PM)_

_`Kambras takes her mind off of Fione and back onto Emmett, considering him for the future._

_Seth winks at Kambras, the three unaware of the recent loss to their crew._

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 06:56 PM)_

> You are a fucking PLANT!

_Jim shakes her head back and forth._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 06:56 PM)_

> Do you want to join us on the ship?

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 06:56 PM)_

_`Kambras`: Kambras sighs._

> `Kambras`: That's a trivial question, Emmett.

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 06:57 PM)_

> `Floran Assassin`: Do you even know what a floran isss?!

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 06:57 PM)_

_Jim stops._

> I have over 12,452 species in my database...

_A couple of seconds pass, and Jim's eye changes from green, to blue, and then back to green._

> Florans are one of them.

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 06:58 PM)_

> Why's that?

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 06:58 PM)_

> `Kambras`: I have daily work to do here before joining you guys, And I have to sign out.

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 06:58 PM)_

> `Floran Assassin`: Then you know that we are a race of hunterssss, with the only thing bigger than our combat knowledge, is our bloodlust.

> Work?

t!8ball Does the floran get comfy in the medbay?

> `Kambras`: Yeah, we have these collars that forbid us from disobeying...

_`Kambras`: Kambras pulls at her collar._

> `Kambras`: They also make us happy... At least, I think they do...

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:01 PM)_

_`Floran Assassin`: The floran leaves Jim to mourn Ibraxas and sees a wanted poster of Seth in the hallway. She snatches the poster and heads out to the casino, where she manages to find him._

> `Floran Assassin`: Are you Sseth?

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:02 PM)_

_Emmett frowns at the revelation that the coalition was, in fact, more a dystopia than a utopia._

> ... We need to get you out of here.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 07:02 PM)_

_Seth looks at the floran and shakes his head._

> Nope, wrong person.

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:02 PM)_

_`Floran Assassin`: The assassin notices Jim and is unable to react before he tackles her._

_Seth takes a sip of some vodka._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:04 PM)_

_Emmett sighs and grabs a hoe._

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 07:04 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 07:05 PM)_

_Seth scoffs, not caring about Ibraxas's demise._

> You mind having sex with that floran elsewhere? You're disturbing my date.

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:05 PM)_

_`Floran Assassin`: The floran stops, disgusted._

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 07:05 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 07:05 PM)_

> Jimmy boy, rape isn't nice.

_Seth winks at Alli, who giggles._

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 07:05 PM)_

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 07:06 PM)_

_Jim scoffs at Seth's nonchalant response._

t!8ball Do security guards hear of the double rape and start running after Jim and his floran?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 07:06 PM)_

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:06 PM)_

> `Coalition Receptionist`: I'm sorry Kambras, but I cannot let you do that.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 07:11 PM)_

> Considering you just killed our shipmate, we are hiring but... we'd have to talk to everyone.

_Seth smiles._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:11 PM)_

> What?

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:11 PM)_

> `Coalition Receptionist`: That collar is your life support.
> `Coalition Receptionist`: Literally.

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:12 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 07:12 PM)_

t!8ball Does Ibraxas's body get cleaned up?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 07:12 PM)_

🎱 | Better not tell you now, Bagelwrecker.

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:12 PM)_

_Emmett, pissed off, looks at Kambras, and notices where Seth shot her was all bandaged up. He figures that the collar was keeping her alive from the shot._

> Then fix her head, squoat damnit!

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 07:12 PM)_

t!8ball Does Ibraxas's body get cleaned up?

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:13 PM)_

> `Floran Assassin`: OW! Fucking SSSSTOP!

_`Floran Assassin`: While the floran wanted to kill Jim badly, killing another member of the crew wouldn't go so well._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:13 PM)_

t!8ball Is the medbay unoccupied?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 07:13 PM)_

_Seth smiles at Alli, losing some interest in Sanya._

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:16 PM)_

> `Sanya`: Sssure.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 07:17 PM)_

_Seth sighs, having to deal with this while on a date._

> Alright, what are your skills and talents?

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:17 PM)_

> They're a super valuable commodity in space. They allow you to pay for resources and labor.

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 07:17 PM)_

_Jim mutters under his breath, outraged._

> Fucking commie...

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:17 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 07:20 PM)_

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 07:20 PM)_

_Jim rolls his eyes, pissed._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:20 PM)_

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:21 PM)_

_Sanya managed to grab her knife from the Mickey Mouse Ghost earlier. She stabs with it in the air._

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 07:21 PM)_

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:21 PM)_

_`Sanya`: Sanya pumps her fist in the air._

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:21 PM)_

_`Sanya`: Sanya grimaces at the thought of sex._

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:21 PM)_

> `Sanya`: I cannot give you a clear answer.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 07:21 PM)_

_Seth groans at her response._

> I'm not asking to have sex with you.

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:22 PM)_

_`Sanya`: Sanya exhales in relief._

> `Sanya`: Oh, thank god.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 07:22 PM)_

> Just asking if you're okay with that.

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:23 PM)_

_`Sanya`: Sanya was clearly not paying attention to the question, thinking more about how a floran could fornicate with a mammal in the first place._

> `Sanya`: Wait, with me?

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 07:23 PM)_

> No.

_Seth takes a swig of vodka, masking his frustration._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:23 PM)_

t!8ball Does the surgery go as planned?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 07:23 PM)_

🎱 | Very doubtful, Zander.

> `Sanya`: Okay, cool.

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 07:23 PM)_

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:23 PM)_

_`Sanya`: Sanya pauses for a bit in thought._

> `Sanya`: Yeah, I'm fine with that.

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:23 PM)_

> `Coalition Doctor`: I have a feeling this will take a while longer. I haven't done brain surgery in a while...

_`Coalition Doctor`: The doctor continues to cut into Kambras's head, shaking a bit._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:23 PM)_

_Emmemtt grimaces._

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 07:24 PM)_

_Jim pinches his brow, finally letting go of his understandable grudge with Sanya._

> Just not on the kitchen table this time please..

**Bagelwrecker** _(04-Aug-18 07:24 PM)_

> Too late, Jim.

_Seth winks at Jim._

**Brakia** _(04-Aug-18 07:24 PM)_

`Sanya`: t!8ball Does Sanya head back to the ship?

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:27 PM)_

> Turns out the bullet wasn't taken out...

_Emmett frowns._

**TheBlade** _(04-Aug-18 07:27 PM)_

_The Tic-Tac head man stops screaming, and cowers in pain from the uppercut._

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:28 PM)_

t!8ball Does it take a few hours for the surgery to finish?

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 07:28 PM)_

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 07:29 PM)_

🤔 | Bagelwrecker, I pick 1 hour!

**Zander** _(04-Aug-18 07:30 PM)_

> HOW AM I ALIVE?!
> AHHHHHHHH!

_Ibraxas then dies. Again._

**Tatsumaki** _(04-Aug-18 07:30 PM)_

🎱 | Most likely, Bagelwrecker.
