**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 09:07 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 09:07 PM)_

_Seth flops back onto his bed._

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 09:07 PM)_

_Emmett kicks the ground, still feeling the pain from his hoof wound._

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 09:08 PM)_

> Good night.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(24-Jun-18 09:08 PM)_

_Asier frowns._

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 09:10 PM)_

_Seth moans into his comms watch._

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 09:10 PM)_

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 09:18 PM)_

_Emmett sighs, staring into the growing black abyss._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(24-Jun-18 09:18 PM)_

> Don't do it!

@Magic8Ball Does Matthias pull Emmett back?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 09:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | YES, Enchantingtable2013.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 09:18 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Do the stonewomen start to fondle Math without his permission?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 09:18 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Bagelwrecker.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 09:18 PM)_

**Enchantingtable2013** _(24-Jun-18 09:18 PM)_

_Matthias feels the cold stone on his body and pushes against the stone statues desperately._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(24-Jun-18 09:22 PM)_

_Matthias continues to struggle._

> GET THIS THING OFFA ME HOMIE!

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 09:22 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Asier save Matthias?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 09:22 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Zander says Yes, but it causes the stone women to rotate around both Asier and Matthias, PlasmaPerson.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 09:23 PM)_

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 09:24 PM)_

> This void has a lot of holes man.

_Seth proceeds to become more aroused._

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 09:24 PM)_

_Emmett hugs the void, somehow._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(24-Jun-18 09:24 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Matthias pull out his shotguns and shoot the shit out of all of the stonewomen, also ripping a hole in the void?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 09:24 PM)_

_Matthias manages to pick up his shotguns from the void and continues to shoot at the statues._

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 09:27 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Emmett hold onto Seth and his Squommy?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 09:27 PM)_

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 09:30 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Zander says they kill some of them, but half of the living ones turn into Math's mom and the other half turn into Asier's mom, PlasmaPerson.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 09:31 PM)_

@Magic8Ball After the void closes, does Emmett immediately grab some grass as comfort food?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 09:32 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Astounding yes, Zander.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 09:33 PM)_

> Maybe if we pinch each other then we'll wake up!

_Asier pinches Matthias before he backs away from him._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(24-Jun-18 09:33 PM)_

> I'll shoot myself in the fucking eye.

**Bagelwrecker** _(24-Jun-18 09:33 PM)_

_Seth humps the air in success._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(24-Jun-18 09:34 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Matthias blow his brains out, therefore waking up?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 09:34 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Nah, Enchantingtable2013.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(24-Jun-18 09:34 PM)_

> IDGAF!

_Matthias points a shotgun at his beak._

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 09:35 PM)_

> I AM EMMETT; YOU KILLED MY SQUOM. PREPARE TO DIE!

_Emmett evilly brandishes his laser crossbow._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(24-Jun-18 09:35 PM)_

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 09:35 PM)_

_Asier snickers._

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 09:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Rolling a d20 to determine... Rolled a 5! No, Zander.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 09:37 PM)_

_Emmett drops the crossbow, upset that Matthias is embracing his potential murder._

**Enchantingtable2013** _(24-Jun-18 09:37 PM)_

@Magic8Ball Does Matthias blow the shit out of his brains, waking himself up?

**Magic8Ball** _(24-Jun-18 09:37 PM)_

ðŸŽ± | Maybe, Enchantingtable2013.

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 09:37 PM)_

> I'm not sure killing each other will wake us up, guys.

**Zander** _(24-Jun-18 09:37 PM)_

_It appears that Emmett's behavior is still corrupted by the void._

> Poopie haha!

**Enchantingtable2013** _(24-Jun-18 09:37 PM)_

> Can't tell until we try!

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 09:38 PM)_

> Fair enough.

**Enchantingtable2013** _(24-Jun-18 09:38 PM)_

_Emmett rubs his eyes in disbelief, seemingly no longer corrupted._

**PlasmaPerson** _(24-Jun-18 09:45 PM)_

> Thanks buddy!

_Everyone contorts back into their normal selves, the distortion of the dream seeming to fade with the disappearance of the stonewomen._
_Asier pets Rawley, having his arms back._

> No, it's a dream...
